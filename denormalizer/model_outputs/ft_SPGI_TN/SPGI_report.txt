then looking back , do * n't forget that 2017 was not that an easy year from sentiment as well in Europe . When I come to the whole trading environment * and there you have to see

but I think I would like to stress here as well the point that there are markets we entered only in the last 3 to 4 years that are still small . But at that level , we can grow nicely .

It is not as if you have a permanent business , then you can intervene 3 , 4 weeks or 6 months or 4 months later when there is something not working .
