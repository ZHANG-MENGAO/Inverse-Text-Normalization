and so although some companies will have a more limited impact because they've been able to improve their environmental performance over the past twelve months which is their whole idea of that program
next year if you think back to our q two results we did announce at that point that
that i can quantify it for you so that it's about thirty million impact
some of you may remember how we started our run in twenty twelve and how altium managed to deliver what could not have been imagined possible at that time
but we're very much focused on pcb very much focused on the mainstream of the market
so there is a plan that we will invest in to get to where we need to be thirty five percent is our baseline we won't go below that but there will be some level of fluctuation as we move forward
we're also in the process of really investing in the future and aram mentioned some of that where we're going to look at things that we need to do today to be able to get to twenty twenty five he mentioned some of those
we have started a major sim swap program already middle of this year we have now extended it to sun customers because we know out of our data that there are more lte devices than
and we will continue our efforts to push the envelope here and not only in the areas where we have built lte today but to make sure that lte becomes available all over the place
we recently spud our first well on the acreage and we intend to perform extensive data gathering on the first four wells
and after the analysis of the data collected from those four wells we'll be further delineating our development program but you can expect it to be a little widespread initially before we go into full-phase development
but that doesn't break the trend over the rest of the year which is a trend to deleverage in terms of net debt-to-ebitda ratios
this is good old cable tactics and as you move to the right on this page you can see that strong customer intake is not diluting home arpu we
so now let me come back to cable for a minute big picture and strategically beginning on slide eleven there is a lot on this page but the message should be pretty clear
and we have been so every day as we were turning the business around both operationally and financially and while we were building those four g and cable fiber networks we had our eye on the cash flows
what i like about it now was that unlike what our growth was three four years ago
we're comfortable with that and if you look at the overall leverage of the company we're still less than two times the leverage towards our capital so while it will have an impact we don't think it will be a significant impact
continue to focus on credit in two thousand and seventeen as we believe these types of assets will deliver more stable returns over current economic industry environments
this brings our development program count in strategic markets to a total of five up from three last quarter
the trends of longer blades taller towers technology advancements and maturing of the industrial supply chains to drive down lcoe continues
we believe that decarbonization of our electric sector and strong economics will provide ongoing growth opportunities for wind energy and for tpi for many years to come
our capex in the fourth quarter was less than anticipated due to the timing of purchases and certain other work moving into twenty eighteen and as a result our capex guidance for twenty eighteen will be adjusted accordingly
and then in order to help drive lcoe down our model has been per the agreements to share a large portion typically of those savings with our customer
is this something -- is this the dynamic as we try and model out through 'nineteen and pass them in does this have legs or is thirty five kind of a sort of new number that we should think about as being sort of steady state
we expect these new lines as well as the transitions and additional startups will position us nicely for strong growth in two oh one nine and we are still confident in our revenue target
and we expect the growth of these markets will continue to drive the outsourcing trend we've seen over the last ten years
in a recent irena report they stated that turning to renewables for new power generation is not simply an environmentally-conscious decision it is now overwhelmingly a smart economic one
we completed our secondary public offering of five point one million shares in may which has helped to improve liquidity of our shares in the public marketplace and expand our investor base
utilities are applying it to grow their businesses and to meet aggressive co two emission reduction goals
owns more wind capacity than any other us regulated utility and by the time its wind eleven project is build out in twenty twenty it will generate enough wind power to cover ninety percent of its load
before i turn the call back to steve i'd also like to highlight our disclosure in the ten-k
although six oh six does not have a cash impact nor an effect on the underlying economics of the company's customer contracts applying the new revenue recognition accounting to contracts in startup and transition
such risks and other factors are described in our form ten-k and other periodic reports as filed with the securities and exchange commission
and in fact we are in active negotiations for a number of lines with the expectation of closing them in the next one to two months
will likely result in higher reported earnings in twenty eighteen than under the previous guidance as revenue is shifted to the initial years of startup and transition activities of a contract
i want to thank the tpi associates for their dedicated effort our customers for placing their trust in us and our shareholders for your continued support
and price the product accordingly but we are actually leaning in we are still leaning in kind of in the same way to help drive down lcoe and pass on a good chunk of the savings to our customers
in connection with our initial public offering we will incur a number of ipo-related expenses or special charges primarily in the second and third quarter
okay so would it be fair to say that q four would be the heaviest
the annual same-store decline was driven by an average occupancy reduction of fifty basis points the beat to our guidance related to signing leases earlier in the quarter than budgeted
the portfolio and core ffo so ultimately the handful of decisions we made to let tenants roll out and then opportunistically either
the long run average has been seventy percent across the portfolio and in some years you're a little bit below that and some years you're a little bit above that and
it's -- when you combine the two it's a good growth story and on that point too we are very pleased with the performance of this business on an operating profitability standpoint
we're also pleased with the performance of class our mattress cover operation with a solid sales and profit contribution for the third quarter
we will also make references to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating loss which are not measures in accordance with gaap for a reconciliation of adjusted operating income and loss to operating income and loss
and to then to do it where you're also having to bring into the workforce over thousand workers and train them in railcar manufacturing
in the last year or two and so if you take those two sort of things that probably gives you a good view of what's going on in the industry some of the companies are pulling back some of the companies are slowing down but a lot of that gap is being filled by some of these credit unions
that -- those two factors would probably give them a significant pick up the other thing would be the extent they're doing more prime and they sort of have maybe a stronger target to go after later then their other recoveries might be improved as well
where would the average age of the portfolio be twelve months from now relative to sort of the nineteen months it currently is i'm just trying to get a sense for the impact of
not the best thing in the world it's not thirty percent but there's certainly a significant possibility given what's going on that they could go lower before they go up it is a little novel that they've slowed down for the moment
one might think that what would influence that number for gm would be that they probably have more prime and so the cars are newer but not so new that you're having a sort of a drive off problem
projects that we have in the tkh group are doing quite well in the execution and that has now also translated into a very positive result of the organic growth
the fact that we have high and increasing order intake with the top five tire manufacturers also means that as we get more market share with them we end up in more locations where they have the facilities and
there are two or three elements in there and the important one is the location of where results are being made there is always a little bit of distribution where results are actually coming to bottom line
for aeroplan before we come back to the overall strategy around coalitions and contract renewals let me touch briefly on slide seventeen to cover performance in international coalitions in the quarter
and it's worth remembering that the vast majority of our five million members are not frequent flyers aeroplan currently helps them to choose air canada for their travel goals
comment on their reaction but i think everybody would focus on the same thing there's three years left to run
this and some that i've said already but the reason i have confidence in our alternatives is we have five million highly engaged members
for those of you accessing the presentation which can be downloaded on the website these can be found on page three of the q one highlights presentation
we're reconfirming our two thousand and seventeen guidance and simplification of the business and operational discipline will continue to drive results
so there's no reason for members to do anything other than continue to engage in the program over the next three years and as we've said
we will continue to work with the commonwealth prepa and other creditors to protect our interest and the interest of our stakeholders in making sure the rule of law is followed
i would like to direct you to slide twenty six and the financial highlights deck for a description of the pro forma statutory basis financial effect of the merger
now i would like to turn the call over to david grande to discuss our third quarter two thousand seventeen financial performance and provide insured portfolio highlights
a full description of the limitations and using non-gaap financial measures and the adjustments made to derive our non-gaap operating income and adjusted book value is included in the earnings release
knowing how it would impact what the dfs would allow you to do or is it just pricing with this other counterparty andrew
for the full year we are on track to generate positive adjusted ebitda at the high end of our guidance range
something which is increasingly sought by our customers physician rcm is therefore strategically very important to us as we think about tying together
the second update on the commercial front is the expansion of our portfolio of modular solutions while we have a large number of modular customers we have historically not proactively marketed our core rcm modular capabilities
we expect to conclude deployment activities at the indiana and florida abms by early twenty eighteen the
in the second quarter we selected a couple of vendors whose technology we will leverage to enable this front-end transformation we have three pilots underway and expect results from these pilots by the end of the year
with this backdrop we methodically selected five modules focused around key rcm performance outcomes where we are in a strong position to drive meaningful value for our customers
across that phase-one footprint a number of those vendors are modular service providers today and so on two dimensions coming out of that work one is just our competitive value prop and to gary's comments
it is not uncommon to see as many as five to six hiring agencies for example at a given health system each functioning in different departments with little or no coordination
control of physician rcm workflow will allow us to integrate processes across the front-end and coding and billing functions as well as developing an analytics layer to support macra and acl analytics
we are on track to turn positive from an adjusted ebitda standpoint as well as free cash flow standpoint in the second half of the year
on slide nine we've laid out the investment portfolio composition for the quarter
despite the overall portfolio growing by approximately thirty percent during the quarter we were disciplined in adding hedges as we increased our exposure to agency mortgages to maintain the duration gap
the bridge securitization was used to help fund a speciality finance company acquiring a large us credit card portfolio that was being sold by european bank
as we look forward we believe mitt is well positioned to take advantage of a wide range of agency and credit market opportunities at favorable returns
this was slightly offset by a decline in the value of our agency rmbs and associated hedges as spreads on shorter duration hybrid arms
and as we've noted on march fourteen we experienced a significant decline in revenue as a result of delays in engine supply from certain vendors
and that future events and results may vary substantially from what the company currently foresees discussion of the various factors that may affect future results is contained in the company's annual report on form ten-k
this is a randomized two-way crossover study in healthy subjects which is a streamlined version of the pilot study and is being run at the same site as the pilot study
we met with the fda in august to review the pilot study data and discuss our next steps
the meeting was very productive and we were pleased with the high level of engagement and diligence of the fda staff
and during the course of the year we were pleased to have perceptive advisors and broadfin capital join essex woodlands as major investors in the company
we expect the first treatment period to be completed in december and the second period in february of twenty eighteen with top line data analyzed and available in the second calendar quarter
and they continue to work tirelessly and safely to maintain our grid stability and for that we thank you turning to slide five i will discuss the latest developments on our texas rate case filing in more detail
is there a thought to going back to issuing 'seventeen guidance or annual guidance
the sale of our ownership interest in four corners on july six not only allows us to become a cleaner utility but will limit our financial obligations relating to potential environmental regulations which of course benefits all stakeholders
with respect to our texas rate case on july twenty one twenty sixteen we filed an unopposed settlement with the public utility commission of texas after continuing to work with all intervenors in the case
as a result of this sale we will be able to reduce by one billion pounds the carbon dioxide from the company's annual emissions
another highlight that i'd like to mention is the construction of montana unit four it remains on schedule
we anticipate that a proposed order will be considered by the puct on thursday august eighteen once approved we will record the effects of the settlement for financial reporting purposes
this means the effective date for new rates could be as early as the third quarter of twenty seventeen even if the schedule for the rate case were to be extended
year-over-year earnings will be positively impacted by the rate increases in texas and new mexico that we discussed on slide thirteen as well as continued customer growth at
but it's strange that you're using texas rates as of january twelve yet you're still experiencing all this lag i'm just a little confused by that
what meets the ferc definition of maintenance and then everything else goes into other except for fuel
our plan is to be fully up and running in these premises by very early two thousand and nineteen and we expect cash payback on the investment in about five years from then
martin ferron chairman and CEO will then provide his comments on our outlook and strategy
first of all it was great to see the revenue accelerate the way it did but i was a bit puzzled that the ebitda margins compressed on a thirty percent increase on the top line i mean the business has always been
following my remarks john will be sharing some data we presented at asco the american society for clinical oncology meeting
additional information that we look to gain at this stage is the understanding of how our drug works in humans this information will include the pharmacokinetics of com seven oh one in humans
this event resulted in our need to reschedule the filing of our IND which was originally planned for q four of this year
and again please let me mention that swiss life will be hosting an investors day next year on the twenty nine of november in order to discuss our new strategic program
by us moving away from traditional products more into unit-linked products and we are also driving this so we actually we are acting on all the three levers
and so from this perspective i am actually pretty confident that we will reach with finma an agreement on the new models
for a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable gaap measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
please see the section titled forward-looking statements and non-gaap measures of our earnings press release which can be found on our website
on a gaap basis including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses
reflecting a four percent increase in our variable annuity average separate account values and the ongoing benefit from the annual assumption updates last quarter
driven by the increased attractiveness of us dollar products in the current environment as well as the introduction of a us dollar whole life product with nursing care benefits last quarter
we believe some of this lift is sustainable but we aren't expecting to maintain that full increase in roa going forward
distribution strategy in the ia channel which will become even more important and a more important distinguishing factor as we go forward so
yes tom it's mark i've been saying i guess over a couple of calls now that we anticipate that at some point we would no longer be designated as a sifi and that there are several ways to get there
we do expect future fee levels to be impacted over time by our product diversification strategy and by the aging of our business slide six presents our annuity sales
as a consequence the vast majority of sales in japan were us dollar-denominated sales outside of japan were consistent with last year as growth in brazil was offset by modest declines in other markets
keep in mind that we run with a very high measure of financial discipline including economics gaap accounting and statutory accounting and we've often said that we can meet higher standards that's not a problem for us
moving to our business results and starting on slide five i'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that i mentioned earlier
turning to slide fifteen international insurance sales on a constant basis
that this is a business that has had fourteen consecutive years of positive net flows from institutional clients
constrained in a major way by the designation but would losing the sifi label affect your approach to capital or just your overall business strategy
we observed strong margins in the quarter as our gaap operating margin
both properties continue to benefit from the on rev -- from new revenue management and operational strategies that we put in place when we took over across the last six to nine months
this said with the many sale transactions we anticipate across the next six to twelve months we also expect to distribute special dividends and use additional proceeds to reduce leverage
our updated guidance also incorporates all of the transactional activity completed to date as well as the anticipated closing of the two suburban boston assets
the sale of these three suburban hotels reflect a continuation of our capital recycling strategy as well as the strong interest from foreign capital and local real estate investors in stabilized select service assets in the best suburban markets
better occupancy the pope's visit was really two days and philadelphia had effectively shut down the city so it made it very difficult and we had a lot of room cancellations across the city
moving on to the segment analysis on slide seven you see that consumer packaging sales were up two percent due most notably to acquisitions
in the first half of two thousand seventeen the use of working capital has been slightly lower than last year but there are many moving pieces within those numbers
in the second quarter our industrial businesses had their best results in nearly three years which helped -- i'm sorry our industrial businesses had their best results in nearly three years which helped offset weaker results in other areas of the company
and the number of skus you can simplify the business a good bit and not really have a significant impact on your urb demand
so is it fair to say that the earnings contribution is also seventy five percent because it sounds from barry's comments like it might be a little more profitable
the differences between gaap and base earnings are summarized on this slide
and sps is a key part of driving productivity for us and those businesses that really embrace it and drive it you can see the consistent results in that part of
as you -- as the market figures out how to get more occ back from the homes
furthermore today's presentation includes the use of non-gaap financial measures which management believes provides useful information to investors about the company's financial condition and results of operation
when you aggregate it all we're doing quite well but specifically in manufacturing productivity -- in the plants that have sps we just have stellar results that have fully implemented it
because we collect approximately twice the amount of recovered paper we consume through our recycling operations we have a partial hedge against rising occ prices
first half of this year there were twenty four and jack mentioned earlier that we have been awarded a number of these projects so we're going to see that start to roll
and in the appendix of today's presentation and now i'd like to turn the call over to our CEO alan mckim alan thanks michael
for the closed loop we continue to target doubling the volume of direct lubricants sold from that of twenty seventeen we remain confident about the compelling value proposition for our direct lubricant offering
good morning everyone thank you for joining us starting on slide three we delivered another strong quarter that exceeded our guidance with both reporting segments contributing favorably to our performance
parts washer revenues were flat despite a slightly lower number of actual services performed in the quarter while waste oil collection volumes dropped more than sixty million gallons up from a year ago
and we are focusing on margins versus volumes at this time with the upcoming changes expected as a result of the imo twenty twenty regulations
and we continue to have steady success we have now surpassed twenty five thousand unique direct customers as of september
the team achieved this while maintaining a zero pay average per gallon
turning to our capital allocation strategy on slide seven as mike will touch on we expect a good cash flow performance this year and will evaluate the best ways to deploy that capital
let me close with our outlook we entered the final quarter of twenty eighteen with momentum supported by array of favorable market trends and internal initiatives that should bode well for us in twenty nineteen and beyond
that's all predicated on the market it's hard for me to predict that right now as we look at q four we're not anticipating it going up or down in our current guidance but obviously oil prices will have a say in that
i mean are you going to kind of look and take the current spread forward or are you going to try to impact -- or try to incorporate some of the impacts the spread could feel for even that waste oil pricing or maybe even vgo pricing
general and administrative costs are higher because of an increase in it costs including costs for our transportation management system and human resource system as well as an increase in professional fees
our new tms so the endgame of this is to provide our operating systems where we have visibility across the network
these new onboardings will continue to ramp up in the first and second quarter of two thousand and seventeen we were also successful securing several multiyear contract renewals the
and then we'll replace our tractors when they're five years old and purchase tractors to support our growth in key markets where it makes sense
during the downturn we took the opportunity to upgrade our rig fleet to one of the most modern and efficient in the industry on the completion side we expect to complete five percent to ten percent more
the curry well is solidly in the oil window as opposed to many scoop stack wells
the outperformance of these new wells allowed our trinidad division to produce fifteen million cubic feet
the tax law enacted near the end of twenty seventeen had a number of effects on eog's results of operations cash flows and consolidated financial statements
in twenty eighteen which billy helms will update you on shortly as a result we are in a position to generate healthy financial returns even in a moderate oil price environment
of realizing the full benefit of premium drilling in twenty eighteen we'll improve in every category we use to measure performance internally
in twenty seventeen we set our sights on drilling longer laterals and larger well packages
of gas per day more than initially forecasted in twenty seventeen we also finalized a new gas contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago
the progress we've made on our capital cost structure operational cost structure and overall capital efficiency these last three years during the downturn has been phenomenal eog has never been more efficient in its history
through these and other efforts we are building on our momentum from last year when we reduced well cost seven percent across active areas
and outpacing our technical learning curve and so in every one of these plays and we've been doing this for two decades now
per boe and the premium reserves we've been adding are beginning to make a significant difference in our bottom line results
to exploration driven organic growth drove increases to premium net resource potential of two point two billion barrels of oil equivalent
those efforts will expand in twenty eighteen our average lateral will be eight percent longer this year and we expect the average size of our well packages to more than double
we continue to increase the size of our well packages and extend lateral lengths while being careful to maintain per foot recovery the goal of these measured improvements is to maximize the npv per section of this consistently prolific asset
the well we highlighted when introducing the woodford the curry twenty one is a fascinating well that continues to demonstrate a very low decline rate particularly considering that it is a shale reservoir
are working together to make eog the leader in organic generation of new and better premium drilling inventory
volumes on the mid-saskatchewan system increased as a result of the connection reactivations and from the completion of several expansion projects in mid-twenty fifteen to accommodate increased regional production
our margins are stabilized and we will continue to focus our efforts on delivering the expected us profitability as well as the integration of the brazilian business following the vigor acquisition
the -- i think we're going to go back and look at what our three-year results look like with the team over the next couple of months
we're happy with what we see as the profitability trend in lala drinkables and we have to make some strategic decisions regarding the culture business
that we took on october fifteen so in the third quarter we have thirty days
we have a lot of learnings on a lot of different experiments that have been done over the past three or four months on the best way to generate trial repeat purchase
and manufacturing strategy in one of those three plants so we need to get into that and we'll come back to you with updated estimates
the repayment of one of our bonds and the acquisition of the minority shares of the now delisted german subsidiary strabag ag in cologne
will to be work off extreme high order backlog of strabag the company is therefore being very selective
of at least a comparable level to that of two thousand and seventeen and to generate improved earnings now that the alto maipo project in chile no longer has a negative effect on the segment's result
the ebit more than doubled as did the income tax level which left a net income
as required by the first time adoption of ifrs fifteen we have commented on this effect already in the previous calls of this year
now why would anyone keep their money in a savings account that offers half the rate of another savings account there's only two reasons one they don't know about the other offer or two the friction and hassle in moving their money
reconciliation between the two can be found in the company's presentation today which is available on its website
it's obviously still very early days in this mission but every quarter we continue to get closer and q three results were another sign that this approach drives real results as demonstrated by our eighty percent growth in core revenue
through the card program so at some point in twenty nineteen we expect the kind of expansion of what we call the premium account
starting next quarter q four we will no longer have any of this legacy revenue in our results which we believe will make it easier for investors to understand our true underlying growth
this morning i'll take a moment to highlight our q three results review our key markets and share our outlook before we take your questions
and after paying out most of our cash on our q two balance sheet as dividends
as a result we have just renewed our normal course issuer bid and are actively planning to repurchase our stock the renewed bid allows us to buy back up to five point two million shares over the next twelve months
since we launched this strategy three years ago our specialty sales volume has increased by more than forty percent the equivalent of one mill's annual production
and they see what they have at hand but i also think what is important in our case is that we have three things in mind when we make those decisions and number one is to make sure that we are compliant
we have opened up one new branch during the quarter and have appointed also two new branch managers for new openings
in more than thirty countries and is a preferred and qualified partner of a number of international organizations and nongovernmental organizations
between eight and ten years of data exclusivity from the date of approval
in the last week of may we have two excellent opportunities to share the probuphine story
the third quarter is the seasonally weakest quarter for the cis business and we expect both revenues and margins to be higher in the fourth quarter
we are benefiting from a better heating season this year after experiencing two years of market declines in addition to market growth we are also gaining market share in our historically strong midwest and northeast region along with making gains in the canadian market
this is higher than last year primarily due to the unfavorable foreign exchange rates and capital spending in our new cis segment in addition we made equipment purchases to expand manufacturing capacity in china
we are also tightening by raising the lower end of our adjusted operating income and adjusted ebitda guidance
we continue to focus on addressing our performance challenges at certain cis locations and on driving operational improvements
it's these environments where if it's long and steady increase it's not a huge quarterly impact and you've seen that in the last three quarters for us
lots of opportunities we have put a few of the foundation pieces in place with it but
assuming the pipeline is fully subscribed the capacity could be expanded to about one million barrels per day
projects are generally geared towards that although we've added quite a bit of nao capacity over the past couple of years also so we're thinking about how do we efficiently move these products into the market
slide five compares first quarter and fourth quarter adjusted earnings by segment
yes so you're right we've seen a number of weeks over two million barrels a day of exports
i guess a driver of some cash that would potentially make its way to the parent company this year or with the organic opportunities available at psxp is that not necessarily something that we would be thinking about
factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our sec filings with that i'll turn the call over to greg garland for our opening remarks
and expect to have three product candidates in clinical development in the first half of two thousand and nineteen during which we expect to achieve a number of important upcoming clinical and regulatory milestones specifically
no severe or serious adverse events have occurred in the phyox trial and there have been no clinically significant changes in electrocardiography vital signs and lab or hematology values
the increase in net loss attributable to common stockholders for the nine month period
and we did not want to be enrolling the pediatric patients in the six point oh milligram per kilogram cohort so that has led to some delay in
yes i think our anticipation is that we start off with the ph one and ph two patients in the first quarter of next year and soon thereafter
the additional millions of dollars and the opportunity cost associated with taking pcks nine through to clinical data i would consider that an external factor and not an internal factor and that has been what has led us to
the agreement contemplates collaboration on more than ten targets in total
that patients follow in ph and being able to eliminate that
we were not expecting a different time of onset but it does appear that in the trial so far our nadir is achieved by six weeks
it helped us enormously in the ph exceed program that we had the single dose study
as a reminder phyox has enrolled twenty five normal healthy volunteers in the group a portion of the study which is complete
we plan to develop this product candidate as a wholly owned program of the company and expect to submit regulatory filings in the first half of twenty nineteen we plan to disclose the program and the development strategy at that time
the increase in direct research and development expense in the three months ended september thirty twenty eighteen was primarily due to an increase in clinical study costs
we expect overall research and development expenses to continue to increase during the fourth quarter of twenty eighteen and for the foreseeable future
was to be repaid from upfront and first year payments from new partnering agreements over the next four years
in these patient populations as the only company developing a therapeutic intended to treat all forms of ph
we are pleased with the antiviral activity we have seen in preclinical studies and believe that rnai-based therapy will one day be a part of the hbv treatment paradigm
given alexion's more than two decades of complement leadership and deep expertise and resources in the field we are pleased to partner with alexion to discover and develop promising new rnai therapies using our galxc platform
reflecting increased activities associated with our dcr-phxc program
these are clearly small numbers if you compare this to hbvs where clearly you will have to study much much larger
which had caused considerable increases in trading volume in the fx market
from that and we expect the level we have seen in q one to be certainly sustainable
since the announcement of the transaction on march one six i ask for your understanding that we will not go into details on the merger during today's call
it's clear that the increase of the arpu is also coming from the fact that we are increasing -- we are starting to increase
thank you for the way analysts and the press have followed the great evolution of tim
but that doesn't mean we are not working to improve the speed of our four g network
but we now see it as an opportunity looking forward tim was and still is the champion of the second voice sim card
please look at the bottom of the page slide eight this is the segment information for technology solutions
at the bottom of the page is slide ten system platforms
which had been strong in the second and third quarters of last year revenue was also impacted by the increased severity of the competitive environment demand in q three was weaker than we originally expected
please turn to the slide at the bottom of the next page slide eighteen technology solutions services
we expect that severe conditions will continue until five g begins rolling out in earnest
next please turn to the top of the next page slide seven this is the breakdown by segment
this was primarily due to the significant impact of reduced revenue in network products next at the top of the next page slide eleven is ubiquitous solutions
please turn to the top of the next page slide thirteen cash flows
the companies that have kind of nibbled around lng have had a hard time really making money in that business the spot returns have actually been pretty horrible
lower opec production supply outages and lack of weather delays prevented the spot market from stepping up to seasonally expected winter trading freight levels
increases in finance costs in quarter four and in the year were mainly due to increases in loans and in libor partly offset by bunker hedge cash receipts
your company has fully implemented all the features that are required for a successful gst rollout we have passed on all the reduction
that said enrollment has been slower than we had hoped in part because of the triple negative space is a very popular space for clinical trials right now with more than three hundred and thirty studies ongoing worldwide
the primary endpoint of the study which required a minimum of six responses in the first fifty two patients to be deemed successful has been met and exceeded with some patients still potentially progressing to response
we believe the phase i portion of the study will complete enrollment in the next few months and that the phase ii portion of the study will initiate by year-end
we'll present the exact data at the esmo meeting coming up in a few months
before i turn the call over to tom i'd like to take a few moments to outline our progress since we last talked in march when a decision was made to discontinue the act iv study based on the recommendation of the data safety and monitoring board
and existing compassionate use patients have been offered ongoing access to rintega on a compassionate use basis and there are currently over a hundred patients on drug
the breadth and depth of the glemba and varli programs should provide us with a data rich two thousand seventeen and clearly define the potential of these product candidates
on a cd forty agonist candidate and you will likely see data from what appears to be a very interesting program later this year
we plan to present data from the study at the european society for medical oncology esmo meeting in october
preliminary evidence also suggested a correlation between biomarker data and stable disease or better in seven of these patients
the second half of two thousand and sixteen will continue to be about execution across the pipeline we look forward to presenting data on glemba at esmo and additional programs likely at citi and ash
as always we are mindful of our cash position we did put an atm in place back in may a vehicle we have used in the past when the markets have not been very favorable
what was interesting about -oh one four is that in the animals we saw a really quite limited toxicity less than we expected and that will allow us to dose escalate
anthony outlines the current status of rintega program we are working hard to understand the details within this data set and will be fully transparent in sharing our findings at the public presentation at sno in november
i have worked with him as part of the consol energy team and he brings a wealth of capital markets and coal industry experience
this ensures that coal-fired generation remained more competitive than it was in the first half of 'sixteen and power plants were able to burn more coal
compared to the end of the first quarter of twenty seventeen as the operational impacts of cyclone debbie in australia were less than previously anticipated
in simple terms the cash component of the acquisition of additional interest in the pennsylvania mining complex that we completed in september of 'sixteen has been almost fully funded through internally generated cash flow
we are maintaining our sales volume and adjusted ebitda outlook provided at the end of the first quarter
but as we came out of the vacation periods csx is struggling a little bit to get ramped up now obviously
you referenced pricing in 'eighteen and sort of not being terribly different from where it was in the first quarter
those preferred units are eligible to convert on september thirty that will be at that point in time that is up to the holder as far as the conversion of those go
dealers that we sell the lsw package through by our choice and the reason being is that we believe
that can produce fifty thousand different skus in the wheel business and there's no one out in the world that has the range
is the fruits of our labor for the last three years just like you talked about with that farmer the situation is
you just watch the tv and it's happening now in europe you can't have
i think in the press release that you could do twenty four tires a day
and i figure it'll probably be another four or five days before they
i point out these comparisons for two years ago not to just search for a silver lining but to show how the titan team has done a good job battling these market conditions and again it takes a team of people working hard
he already knows all our customers very well so we really just need to change the logo on his shirt and he'll be out there strengthening our relationships with our oem customers
is just like you mentioned you've got the crazy guy and i go see the big farmers who all have more than one piece of equipment
but we do want to confirm an outlook of eight percent to ten percent organic revenue growth again next year with an expectation
the corporate payments category continued to perform well and was up twenty eight percent organically during the quarter
like the core business as it sets up i think the big big opportunity that some others have demonstrated is this downmarket full ap thing that we've been working on and modeling and finally launched that
the growth in this category was driven primarily by adding more accounts and more spend our toll business had another great quarter up seventeen percent organically the growth in this category was driven primarily by a combination of more new sales
excluding these impacts in both quarters operating expenses would have been up approximately seven percent the
i'd say we're pretty comfortable at eight because it doesn't require really a lot of delta sequentially in what we're doing
inside of the four businesses that we're already in and so i'm not trying to hedge it but i think it's just -- it's a pacing question it's how fast
this excludes dilution from the novadaq acquisition that glenn will cover in his section
with our specialized sales force we will be able to broaden the reach of novadaq's technology as we look to leverage our highly complementary customer bases
subsequent to the quarter end sage received an fda warning letter which relates to an inspection last september shortly after we closed on the acquisition
we also have seen real uptake over the last x number of quarters from our new product portfolio and the investments we made over the years in three d printing
i don't have an update on the timing for publication of the dawn data i think you really have to look at all of those factors
as we look ahead to the balance of the year we are excited about the pending acquisition of novadaq which will add a key growth driver to our high-performing endoscopy division
i think the biggest gating item right now is our ability to hire -- identify hire and train the mako specialists who are critical to ensuring that not just the surgeon but his entire or staff is prepared to have a really successful
to be able to give us some really unique product offering that if you look at our cementless offering is now approaching twenty percent of our knees are now cementless which is
dawn and some of the previous studies that have come out that are contributing to the interest in ischemic treatments that are mechanical based
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the sec
of note we continue to see solid uptake for mako upgrades which remain on track and should position us to largely complete all us system upgrades
which has the impact of reducing growth by roughly one percent as previously stated selling days generally do not have an impact on the performance of our capital businesses
our third quarter range does not assume any dilution related to novadaq however if the deal closes earlier than september thirty there will be additional dilution during the quarter
as they work through some of those challenges associated with the -- those deals but we're not going to break out with specificity as we did through the first four quarters nor do we with other deals that -- after we announce them
which is what i think you're referring to which is really a sku rationalization program that we're putting in place to sort of harmonize
also the discussions will include certain non-gaap financial measures reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures can be found in today's press release
the latter of which we recently received a warning letter related to last year's recall we remain on track with the eps accretion for both deals as their growth will accelerate through the remainder of the year
range of motion stability discharge to rehab and patient satisfaction we expect to begin to see some of the data at key orthopaedic conferences starting in twenty eighteen and beyond as we track these patients over time
which excludes any anticipated dilution related to the planned acquisition of novadaq technologies
allow us to drive stronger knee market share as we exit two thousand and seventeen so i think you should kind of think about a rolling four-quarter knee growth and that's kind of the base we assume we'll improve upon
we expect to start shipping for the first of the eleven hundred homes in the fourth quarter
where you will also find our press release which contains supporting details including reconciliations of non-gaap information referred to in the release and on this call
and that's what we have to deal with how do we convince new people to come in when we say when we give twenty percent discount price it's a major thing
after a hectic last quarter of the government's fiscal year ending september thirtieth we expect the process to start again in november
these metrics are not meant to replace gaap measurements but are provided as supplements to assist the public in their analysis and valuation of our company
when our visibility went to zero we could not remain comfortable with our political guidance and we therefore communicated our honest assessment by withdrawing that guidance
guidance for q four and the full year first of all our guidance does not include any pending acquisitions such as green bay and davenport
extravagant in our political assumptions to make the leverage ratios look good we're being a little bit conservative that far out and our leverage ratio is still going into the four makes us feel very comfortable
significantly where they were in 'twelve wisconsin we have one of the small markets there saw basically no spending in what was supposed to be a very contentious race and then as you may know the
candidates on both sides of the presidential contest this year spent far less than their two thousand and twelve predecessors in addition neither political party spent any significant money supporting their nominee with advertising and many of the super pacs skipped the race entirely
simply put we anticipate that the total repurchases in any given year would range approximately between ten percent and twenty percent of our free cash flow
the performance of these two businesses was not enough in the quarter to offset the margin impact from thermal management
the other main issue is we've been hoping that mro would recover throughout this year
this concludes today's conference call today's call will be available for replay in approximately two hours' time to listen to the replay
with erico and enclosures performing as expected and thermal completing the large canadian projects we still believe technical solutions remains well positioned longer term
the result of which should be margin expansion from all three segments next year
that's what we hope you took away that yes we think q four is an anomaly but if you take a look at the overall core growth for the company a negative one and moving to that general framework next year
and that is roughly a one to two percentage point growth over where it was on a full year basis last year
while the results of erico are captured as acquisition contribution the business performed in line with our expectations at the completion of the one-year deal anniversary
and thank you all for joining us today i'll be starting on slide four we delivered third quarter results that operationally met the high end of our forecast and were slightly above our guidance
the majority of erico sales are into commercial vertical which continued to deliver growth in the quarter although the rate of growth is moderating
for the full year please turn to slide twelve labeled balance sheet and cash flow
high single digits throughout the year and had moderated back to flat in q three and then also we had the water purification business which also was strong most of the year and took a little bit of a pause in q three so that's where the misses came steve
and so when you talk about the beverage projects should we think about that bucket of revenue is that about three five oh of sales that's kind of
you did mention that in some parts of ap where you are present you are kind of going a little slow because it's cash economy
those risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in filings the company submits to the securities and exchange commission including its quarterly reports on form ten-q
i encourage you to review these reports for the full details but i will touch on five highlights here
summarize we continue to execute on the two core components of our business strategy
its annual reports on form ten-k and its current reports on form eight-k
now that it's six people when it used to be just one person of just telling that story of what first defense does how you can avoid another vaccine to your cow
no other product presently on the market can offer this value proposition work is underway to complete the two remaining technical sections required for approval of the new animal drug application for mast out
also during today's call we will discuss non-gaap financial measures which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's financial performance
before reviewing the forward-looking statements as retiring cfo i wanted to express my gratitude and appreciation
overall gnl had a strong third quarter and our portfolio continued to exhibit the characteristics of being one of the best portfolios in our industry
comparing to last quarter adjusted ffo is slightly down partially due to the timing of the recognition of income tax expense which chris will go into in more detail later
in addition we closed on an additional four properties shortly after the quarter closed
while still exhibiting a great amount of discipline with respect to credit risk being able to source these types of opportunities while still maintaining gnl's high
removing concerns about upcoming debt maturities in gnl's capital structure we are also able to achieve the extension of these debt maturities while keeping our cost of interest relatively flat
we refer all of you to the company sec filings for a more detailed discussion of the risk factors that could cause these differences
prepared in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure is available in our earnings release
going from weighted average interest rate of two point seven percent at the end of the second quarter
in a few minutes brett will provide additional perspective on the phase ii data but we're pleased with these results and especially gratified by the responses from key opinion leaders in neurology with whom we've discussed the data set
with a seven millimeter mercury or greater increase at all time points on all clinic visits
as we had hoped to show when we undertook part c we believe the durability of effect on dizziness and blood pressure
in a study design intended to improve efficiency and accelerate the clinical program fda and ema have agreed to the design features
the first ten of those patients were considered for part b and they were in fact randomized to either active or placebo and their blood pressure was assessed in the double-blind phase that i shared the data for
and one of the patient had a report of new supine hypertension not previously reported but those were the only two and as reported in the early part a of the study
these clinicians support the view that these data are clinically meaningful and highly encouraging and that nine eight five five has the potential to be a transformational treatment for this debilitating condition
observed in patients on active therapy after four weeks of dosing may prove to be one of the key differentiating features for nine eight five five we will continue to track all patients through the remainder of their five month treatment period
i'd like to provide a little bit more detail on these two cohorts to provide further context in support of our confidence to progress the programs in both ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease
in terms of tissue pk taken from IFC samples of the affected gut wall there was evidence of dose-related increases in local gi tissue drug concentrations
we and our partner janssen are very excited about the progress in the fourteen seventy three program and its potential to transform the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases
but while we were conducting part b we acknowledged and recognized that there were several of these twenty seven patients requesting extension on their therapy
for the risk of supine hypertension in the evening both therapies need to be administered at least three hours before patients lie down to prevent the risk of overshooting on blood pressure
a total of forty eligible patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis were enrolled across the three cohorts
as you look at the earlier time points perhaps at one week and then as you also look at the data at four weeks is it possible to give us some sort of a sense of
we were very encouraged not only by the percentage of patients reporting improvements in this portion of the study but also by their request to continue therapy beyond a single dose which led to the addition of part c to the study
recall that patients were eligible to be enrolled in part c based on their blood pressure response in part a not on the severity of their dizziness
at one week of dosing and droxidopa has not been shown in clinical studies to produce durable response beyond two weeks
the most notable findings were that endoscopic improvements and even mucosal healing were reported in each of the three active treatment arms
when we apply the same threshold and by the way that change of two point three was seen at one week that was the deepest response they got they
in business we've seen a steadily improving revenue trend in the last two years and we remain on track to stabilize revenues
and in response to these developments we significantly simplified our portfolio to focus on converged communication and it services
we lose part of the isdn lines due to rationalization yet we are migrating the remaining isdn customers to kpn one and we are witnessing two clear benefits
our strategic focus on targeting communications and it services in one contract
in order to identify the value of five g technologies we are starting pilots with a number of business partners through these use cases we will determine the value of new technologies for different industries
takes place under the current ec framework and the last time
really on track to deliver on the promises we made two years ago we are doing
we have done already pilots internally and demonstrations and some of the services that now require three weeks or even four weeks to deliver to a customer and
such as the oss integration five g technologies and virtualization the next steps in simplification and digitalization will enable us to improve even further our customer experience
the revenue trend in the fourth quarter showed a strong improvement supported by growth in integrated solutions and it services
this will enable us to phase out some of the traditional environments in kpn and reduce operating costs considerably
this will be essential in the further development of five g and decisions on when how and where to deploy
before turning to the quarter presentation i would like to draw your attention to the safe harbor statement on page two of the slides that also applies to any statements made during this presentation
the transformation of the business is on track reflected by a strong improvement in mps and improving revenue trend
the routit distribution platform enables us to process significantly more orders and also resulted in a very strong increase in mps this efficient delivery chain forms a solid platform for further accelerate
for national consultation is scheduled by acm yes somewhere in the first quarter of this year we argue -- we will argue in that consultation for a level playing field
in two thousand and seventeen a straight line going forward but we are confident that we will
segment where tele two and t-mobile are very aggressive leveraging the low utilization in their network and that's also the reason why we have taken the decision
this will be a key driver for kpn's future performance alongside quality improvements we see numerous revenue opportunities and further potential to lower spend
the results in the first two quarters are in line with our expectations the inflow arpu is somewhat lower than last year because we unbundled content
overall we see that our strategy of moving customers to integrated solutions and growth in it is working
in sme we focused fully on our kpn one product and we are seeing steady progress in large enterprise and corporate due to the introduction of a number of focused propositions
growth and facilitate migrations into two thousand eighteen the kpn one portfolio is very important to us it's the basis for up and cross-sell of additional services to sme customers
in the first quarter our volumes declined three percent a portion of that decrease was expected as we executed our margin management and pruning actions
our new us organization allows us to better serve our customers and suppliers by bringing the right expertise and a tailored supply chain to meet their needs
with about eighty five percent of the market in the hands of our competitors we see this as a golden opportunity to win new profitable business at a much faster pace
to eight point two percent margins also benefited from two extra billing days in europe this quarter due to the timing of the easter holiday which will reverse in the second quarter
let me now address our outlook for two thousand and seventeen and the second quarter on slide eleven we are making good progress against our commercial greatness and operational excellence initiatives
and chief operating officer of univar david's a seasoned experienced growth champion and senior executive with more than thirty five years in chemicals and plastics distribution
i personally attended this event and came away highly impressed by the talent level energy and commitment displayed by our emea sales leadership team
the remaining growth in first quarter adjusted ebitda in emea can be attributed to higher gross profit margins
moving then to slide eight and our rest of the world segment sales were essentially flat with the prior year as higher average selling prices
okay and the i guess some of the power plants it looks like you're going to be building over the next five years do those need some kind of approval before you start construction or do you just build them and get recovery later on or how does that -- how should we think about that
putting incremental capital to work and a lot of things that the three of us described a few moments ago that's generally the strategy when we think about repositioning the portfolio
this represented the culmination of over twelve months of working with the five arches team allowing us to validate our market thesis and confirm cultural and operational fit
which contributed to a thirteen percent increase in economic net interest income in twenty eighteen along with meaningful gains as we continue to optimize our portfolio
overall performance in mortgage banking in twenty eighteen reflects the diversity of our sourcing and syndication channels and our continued efforts to use our capital more efficiently
or considered as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap they are included to aid investors in further understanding the company's performance
and whether they have any relevance to the future development of ab-four five two the class of molecules or the mechanism of action
we believe we have a very strong team with the skills experience and commitment to developing a curative combination regimen for hbv patients
we are confident the rna destabilizing mechanism we are focused on represents a very relevant and important therapeutic target
now also elsewhere in mozambique we are evaluating three high potential blocks for which we were awarded the right to negotiate exploration and production rights
we believe the project will be well positioned to supply lng customers in markets around the world exxonmobil will lead the construction and operations of the planned onshore facilities
so as you highlighted brad moving into your second -- your first question there are a number of lng projects that we are concurrently progressing
we have a very long well-established and successful partnership with sabic and this is something that in our broader business dealings both parties wanted to do and we saw that this was a
as such exxonmobil will contribute its expertise in project execution and operations to support the project's success in a globally competitive lng market
after liza-four the rig will drill a delineation well at payara that will also test a deeper exploration prospect
but i would tell you the commercial structure will be such that it will certainly underpin the substantial investments required for these lng projects
turning to slide eight i wanted to update you on some of our twenty eighteen priorities as we approach the end of our fiscal year now that we've essentially completed our stand-up activities
we're also planning to invest an additional nf three capacity in asia
what we've been doing is making sure that we're making the right decision i think there's a time where we're making significant investments and we've prioritized am
we're confident that this investment along with our organic capital investments for growth and productivity will lead to future margin expansion turning to slide seven i will cover the industry dynamics and outlook
turning to slide nine as we look to the future we are excited to be a leader in this industry with our diverse portfolio and leading market positions we see many catalysts for continued profitable growth
we expect process materials to continue to benefit from the growth of underlying msi and increasing three d structures like vnand advanced materials is expected to benefit from the same trends
we have two production units in hometown and we have converted the first unit to the same technology we already use in our korea plant
will reoccur every three to five years based on market growth and capacity needs
and on the sip side what that basically is profits we recognize in the delivery systems business particularly on percent complete accounting projects
and we wanted to make sure that we're looking at all our options on an nf three do we expand in korea or do we build a new greenfield site and that's the part of the work that we're finalizing at this point in time
plus growth of new materials required for advanced nodes at ten and seven nanometers transition to the next
third is china because if you get the pors with the two big korean players half the market in china is really memory from
and we will be using the same strategy of refinancing for upcoming operations as well now i'll remind you that in the real estate line in the consolidated statements you have two compartments the first one is carried out with the financial
in the coming years some of these projects have already started as you can see on this slide three examples of what we have built or are about to build a new
ago this road map is going to be implemented over the next three years because it implies substantial changes
specializes in servicing these chronic conditions linked to aging and the age average of our patients for this division is seventy five years of age so we have launched a far-reaching
reported on june thirty and accounted for as equity and the net debt impact of change in parameter and others
money in that range so we have two things that we need to weigh
and i think as a combination of those two events we will get further confidence in the product and i believe that's going to drive
and this also translates into reduced ballast and positioning payment so that when we combine this with the lower utilization you do get a drop-off in tce for the period
while much has been said of the upstream us shale expansion i'll remind you that this has not been an area of historical focus for rotork i will note however
let's take a closer look at our execution in twenty eighteen and our twenty nineteen focus within each of these pillars
and also to ten subsidiary offices demonstrating lean expanding beyond operations
after our external assessment of our senior leaders in the first half of twenty eighteen we quickly developed and implemented our internal talent review and succession planning programs
many of you may recall in our customer survey work done in the first half of twenty eighteen the issue of quote turnaround times rose to the top in the list of concerns
towards the end of twenty eighteen we saw a high degree of oil price instability causing some of the larger programs to pause for what we believe is a short term
we didn't want to say we're going to wait three years for these key-enabling pieces of the solution to come so we took that step and developed that middle layer which gives us those
no i don't think there's a rule of thumb i think if you look at what happened in october and november in a five- to six-week period it was the most volatile period
in not only developing new products in the engineering functions of designing new things that would simplify our rfs offering
in the first half of twenty eighteen we also experienced several major project wins principally in asia which we delivered upon in the third and fourth quarters
about our outlook for twenty nineteen so first we do welcome the recent stabilization of the oil prices
moving on to operational excellence we began twenty eighteen utilizing third-party consultants to assist in the assessment of our operations and the identification of targeted improvement activities
each of these consolidations are continued to be evaluated on a risk-adjusted return basis with a desire to average a payback period of less than two years
now turning to our key enablers the execution within our next two pillars is critical to the achievement of our aspirations
and further we'll continue our commitment to bring additional diversity into our business one example of this is our joining of the thirty percent club which entails a commitment between our chairman
it's important to note that the vast majority of these revenues meaning greater than ninety percent will shift to newer generation products with improved margins and reduced manufacturing complexities
overall we expect full year margins to show progress on twenty eighteen i remain very enthusiastic to be leading rotork and i'm very pleased with the level of execution our team has continued to demonstrate
we saw hesitation in the release of similar larger projects in the second half of twenty eighteen largely due to significant fluctuations in oil prices and increasing uncertainty on a variety of economic fronts
we've selected our go-forward enterprise technology platform as the microsoft dynamics three six five platform and hitachi solutions as our systems integrator and our implementation partner
the application set with the pipeline having a gas right and they're very clear about these sites having kind of a two-tier strategy
so there's been a huge focused effort on integrating instruments in particular with the rfs business that utilizes a lot of them
it's the instruments engineering team working with the rfs team in designing ten standardized packages that cover ninety percent of our range for example so that's a major ongoing new product development initiative
i'll then return and discuss the progress we're making on our growth acceleration programme and say a few words about our outlook for twenty nineteen my first year at rotork has been one of change and significant progress
the improved labor productivity wasn't sufficient to offset a seventy basis point increase in material costs
for these initiatives our twenty nineteen focus will be to continue and build upon our strong progress to date
each of these categories are providing net savings ranging between five percent and eight percent we've been actively staffing the procurement organization and we are now at eighty percent of our expected staffing levels
taking our hr function from that of a purely transactional organization to one which recognizes the value in and power of our human capital and serves as a true partner to our business
additionally we initiated a detailed product line review identifying a number of product lines to be withdrawn from production over the next eighteen months
i'll close out by making a few comments on the outlook for this year twenty eighteen began with very strong oil prices which supported expansion and larger programs
so quite a few in the ifrs business for example so as you would expect we keep a very good
we've had many sessions with those two teams coming together having joint new product development efforts
that we pulled resources from other areas on to focus on that particular program and that's a great example of those two working together to really drive an improvement in our business
perhaps just as important we were able to stabilize the clarient volume which had been on a steady decline over the last three years
we're also pleased to report that the volume of tests processed per day increased each month during quarter one so there is good solid momentum in the business
we believe that our combined portfolio of over one hundred and seventy five managed care and large account arrangements is strong and a key foundation for continued growth
as part of this we're working very hard to create a one company culture with a common understanding of values and behaviors and attributes of a high-performance team
local oncologist as a result of using us as their reference lab so i would say those are three important value proposition drivers
the equipment's expensive the techs are very specialized and they're not easy to hire and there's a lot of process around doing fish and doing multiple menu fish menus like we have we have over sixty different fish
in addition to the strong sales performance we also benefited from a stable reimbursement environment in quarter one this is a welcome relief from the situation we faced over the past six years
laboratory information systems and the consolidation of our two southern california facilities
laboratory information systems are extremely important to smooth operations and efficiency and we are integrating two similar but different lab systems
we continue to compile results in the development of our neolab liquid biopsy prostate cancer test an early analysis supports the results of the first two studies
and five the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature related to the preferred stock that is required by gaap accounting
so i think those are two key drivers of our value proposition now pathologists use us as their laboratory
we evaluated restructured and reorganized the entire sales organization within three weeks of closing the clarient acquisition
expected increases in medicare fish reimbursement were slightly offset by slight medicare decreases in other testing areas
we're currently offering this test commercially and have just hired two sales representatives and a product manager to more aggressively market the test
that you're bringing online now could you just take a step back for us and just kind of review your value proposition for clients so obviously you're becoming one of the lowest cost providers of fish
over the last five consecutive december quarters so it's not surprising that this quarter saw modest growth
we will grow same-store sales five percent to ten percent and that we will have leverage in line with the last few years
would you look to reduce it a little bit further is there no change in how you're thinking about it from three months ago or -- it doesn't sound like there's promotions in the market just curious how you're thinking about that aspect of the business
generally based on the notion that the industry would be up about five percent and that you would get a little bit of pricing so
which makes this year our best first quarter in our over twenty-year history the
as brett explained the primary reasons for the increases were related to a new store an acquisition in twenty eighteen and the ramp-up of our charter business
with our energized team and positive consumer confidence we are ready to build upon our strong start in fiscal two thousand nineteen as we continue to change people's lives by connecting them with their family and friends
if you take a look at the underproduction in nafta that we were front-loading the underproduction this year
the august shutdown in q three and then we'll see where we are in terms of meeting our channel inventory objectives for the year
we reserve q four depending on where we are in inventory about the level of production performance so CV should look like every other year in terms of seasonality and ag will be less back-end loaded
i mean the -- if you look at the slide and look at the relative cuts in production those are relative to production numbers in q one where we had already cut so you can imagine the levels that we're running at right now
we are encouraged by the improved operating profits and margins in our industrial segments compared to last year which has allowed us to offset a significant portion of the profit margin impact from ag
slightly down compared to the first quarter of 'fifteen on a constant currency basis primarily due to the decline in ag sales
on ag side i think you need to be careful not to model in that fourth quarter margin that you saw last year which is heavily influenced by the fact
for the year and the reason that we had upgraded unit volume demand for 'sixteen for continental europe is influenced by southern europe so at least through the balance of this year we expect it
of the russian market we don't see it quite yet but at least the dialogue is improving from where it's been over the last forty eight months or so
so i -- we don't -- i -- we may be ahead of the cycle in terms of the introduction of tier three and electronic transmissions already so i don't expect
before we delve into our results i want to take a moment and recognize dave rogers as one of our fore founders and for his thirty five years of service and commitment to life storage
with respect to these asset exchanges we have traded stores that were on average twenty seven years old for stores that are on average seven years old
joe can you talk about the incremental changes that you're contemplating for lsi and what we can expect where you would focus more on
with the strongest trends in vegas new york new jersey new england buffalo la sacramento and cleveland our view of supply remains generally unchanged and our watch markets are the same
dave has been a value leader as ceo and as a pillar in the industry and we are lucky to have them remain on the board where we can continue to benefit from his perspective
do you think might be dependent on an extension of the ptc and what are your current thoughts on whether that will occur and the impact that that would have on your business for next year
i think some of these lessons have been expensive i fully understand that but i believe the organization is a lot stronger than it was eighteen months ago
and because of high usage of qc labor as we were struggling to deal with challenging environmental conditions and to correct problems in our paint line
we are in active discussions and would expect a significant order in q four this is a prime example of how uncertainty around the renewal of the production task credit disrupts the supply chain
because steel is essentially a pass-through to our customers this doesn't impact our economics but does change the reported order number for the nine months orders are slightly above last year despite the pricing adjustment
for our rental business in terms of cat equipment but in general your comments around may be coming to the end of the cycle on used versus new was probably pretty fair
i am encouraged by an improvement in our working capital sales ratio which is the lowest we've seen in the last six quarters
we estimate that the escondida strike reduced our ebit margin by about thirty basis points in the quarter and we expect a similar impact in the second quarter
okay and i guess along a similar line as you think about optimizing your supply chain and increasing roic how do you balance those objectives against the potential for
the uk now ranks amongst the top cat dealers in the world for registered customers and users in this region our e-commerce channel is complemented by parts direct our centralized parts order processing team
the uk and ireland market remains uncertain in the wake of brexit and the upcoming general election this is mitigated somewhat by the opportunity to participate in significant infrastructure projects
yes again i think a couple of things going on in the quarter in canada that allowed the margins to improve one was mix so relative to q one last year where we had
we also had good progress on the ned market path we went out with a customized offering for the electric load in new england
from the end of january of two thousand and sixteen to the end of may may twentieth of two thousand and sixteen we're still working through the full effect of that
as i've said the last two quarters changes in revenues is not a good predictor of our performance
we're still maintaining where we were in terms of demand for co two but we did not need to ramp up as quickly and that's mostly
and that would be over one hundred years of remaining resources relative to the current us natural gas demand
which is a good thing we have issued into this challenged equity market for the last two quarters creating at least a perceived overhang in the market for our equity
we believe in the medium and long term the market will value our common equity appropriately and we believe the market will value our particular structure that is a simplified large-cap c-corp with a substantial and growing dividend also appropriately
as we've said before with what's happened in energy over the last twelve months the coverage we projected last year and the consolidation transaction has taken a substantial hit
we're continuing to generate the cash flow as i said if we want to grow at ten percent we can grow at the ten percent so what i think people ought to be concerned about is what's happening in the underlying business
so now we think that we probably can grow at ten percent longer term but that the coverage would be very tight and could be negative in some years
on forward-looking statements and use of non-gaap financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release
until we see additional demand the additional production that we got from the first six wells or so was enough to take care of what we think we need so
georgia dot decision we believe we've demonstrated need or that our customers certainly have by having signed up the contracts that they did and so we continue to make progress on it continue to pursue it and believe we'll get it done
we're going to continue to focus on the neb process that we're involved in and all the requirements of that while we continue our project
first or next four calendar years after completion of the transaction the implementation costs will be incurred in the first two years after closing
in twenty twenty and at the same time then as you gradually move the volumes from one network to the other you will also
that's also what is stated in the presentation that we expect implementation cost to be cost in the first two years
and when we presented our q three numbers we had the good news of the fact that we've won the court case with the cbb and i don't know how to translate in english cbb but
that will take at least three to four month but as you do know acm can ask questions to us
when there will be a decision of acm and when the decision will not change from what we see
what we did do in 'eighteen is adjusting the organization and that's how we did it is what you see on this slide as well as a gateway to europe
every number you see going forward is based on the assumption that we get an approval in q four two thousand and nineteen but also here with the caveat that it can take longer and then of course
of utmost importance when it comes to future cost savings and potentially a new conclusion of acm on significant market power
so more or less stable or comparable to what we've seen in twenty nineteen please note that there's one working day less
and that's what we want to address at a capital markets day which will be organized on may seven that is also the day in which we will announce our q one figures of two thousand and nineteen and it will be combined with the capital markets day
in the number five recovery boiler unit manufacturing costs were consistent with the previous quarter
clearly i think all of us have been pleasantly surprised by just how stronger markets have been even in the last six months and even as we look at
we know that supply has become more of an issue in the bc interior yet at the same time we know there's probably going to be a lot of salvage
the pulp market appears well positioned for the remainder of the first quarter and into the standard spring maintenance period in q two we continue to be cautious around incremental pulp supply but are encouraged by good demand from most regions
actually were down there a couple of weeks ago with couple of our board members to and we had chance to see some of it first hand but there's clearly a lot of it down there and that's why we put a lot of effort in there in the last six to nine months
now turning to page twenty now we have a deep look on our financial figures
this is due to the fact that we brought forward some planned maintenance activities early in two thousand and fifteen in order to accelerate efficiencies in the second half of the year
in the retail segment we have significantly increased the number of the customers in particular we have reached ten million free market power and gas customers in italy
on top of this we continue to show a solid progression on the target growth to twenty nineteen more than half of our target is secured as we speak
most of the major overall of the company and the business plan is being taken care of during 'fifteen and 'sixteen and those are the years that we wanted to protect
into having most of the project in operation by the end of twenty seventeen this gives us significant flexibility in our ability to adapt to our capex plan for
i think the enel gp definition of challenging was in front of an acceleration that we have
this builds on the acquisition of dearbytes in january and further strength and scale and capability of kpn's security and public cloud services for all of our sme large enterprise and corporate customers
for example we recently concluded a large deal with abn amro where we will provide connectivity and security services
but they can also change from a handset subscription towards a sim-only subscription especially also because besides the effect of the
although service revenues are lower year-on-year we see that the customer lifetime value per subscriber is actually improving again since the first of may driven by the factors i just mentioned
this new proposition is based on our consumer proposition and provides business features such as dedicated customer service and a promise to be back online within twelve hours
specific percentages on a per quarter bases are always somewhat volatile but we do see a further progress in business driven by the bundling in sme growth of it and new services and of course an improving
furthermore these customers also receive fixed mobile benefits offered within kpn compleet in sme we see strong interest in our converted fixed mobile and it services
by the end of twenty nineteen we managed the simplification program on a project by project basis and expect
stripping these out the dutch revenue trend was in line with last quarter and adjusted ebitda relatively flat jan kees will elaborate further on this later in the presentation
of our three factories will actually play out for the fourth quarter that's going to define the level of profitability for us in data centers in the fourth quarter and that's the uncertainty we have
we have two points several large orders have been received relating to the swine segment in our business area aghort and swine production
we can see that here we have various projects in both emea but mainly asia pacific growing well whilst again america has been a little bit lower
and it is in services so it's in those three areas where we have the main investments in the air treatment business
absent reversal by the ninth circuit pge's claim against the surety will be tried in two phases the first phase will be -- will determine whether pge's termination of the contractor was appropriate
is currently set for trial in june of twenty seventeen the second phase will determine damages and will proceed only if pge is successful in the first phase
which was partially offset by an increase in the decoupling mechanism and the august one price increase for placing carty into service
i would tell you as you look out over time absent any new technologies those numbers start coming down because we pretty much saturated the market with things like led lighting and more efficient appliances and things like that so
referring to slide two i'd like to make our customary statements regarding portland general electric's written and oral disclosures there will be statements in this call that are not based on historical fact and as such constitute forward-looking statements under current law
including deliver operational excellence by meeting our twenty sixteen operating and financial performance target
and if the irp is acknowledged when could capital start flowing towards that and would that capital potentially displace
and so while there is continued pressure on adding renewables my sense is we need to get to the fifty percent first before we take the next step and see how we are doing
compared to twenty fifteen and a slight decline in commercial and industrial deliveries
wind generation for the remainder of the year based on five years of historic levels
and preparing for the trial in june on phase one of the case around whether the termination was proper
last week we announced our support of the dea's national drug take back
the proceeds from this disposition were used to repay the reit's construction facility and the remaining proceeds will be used to complete the retail parking garage being constructed at the office complex
and we may lose one or two and replace them so we don't really see that there's a lot of
at pretty attractive numbers but before we actually commit to pull the trigger on those we want to make sure we have a place to roll the money to so that we can execute the ten thirty one effectively
also during the quarter the reit was pleased to provide occupancy to porsche cars canada at their newly developed dealership head office and training center located at the reit's consumers road complex
secure and then there's another one in houston that we're hopefully going to at least make it to the shortlist so i think that if i'm picking up two out of twenty it's certainly not as good as it was twelve months ago
maybe four weeks or one month minimum or maybe twelve months depending on the contract we agree upon with the customer
the remaining six months and we will talk to most of you at the capital markets day and those that cannot participate we will hear at least or can hear us
let's go through the details of the business units and i continue on page six of the slide deck
and this shows the excellent integration we have achieved between the two teams achieving a record time in opening this first store
so now you don't need to take away the merchandise you just pay and go and you get it delivered a few hours later to your home this is very successful has been deployed in six large cities in france and will be further expanded
this number of closures is a slight acceleration compared to the rate of six closures we've had in the previous years
that we can have in 'nineteen is the beginning of the investment on our new distribution center in the north of france that's
we believe the rpo market has tremendous potential on a worldwide scale
and organic growth without it's going to be a very similar spread than what it was here in the second quarter which is about three points of drag overall really for the company and pretty close or the same for staffing services
in april we were notified by amazon of their intent to shift our scope of services over the next year the shift is to assist them with their highest-growth segment of their delivery system as they ramp up more local delivery systems over the next two years
we've seen that again here for the first six months of -- with california i mean you could pretty much say minimum wage went into effect at this point in time
our top priority here remains to produce strong organic revenue growth across all aspects of our business and leverage our cost structure to generate increasing ebitda margins
and then lay the two lines of the revenue trends over one another and they look almost like identical
significantly we finally had the functional team in place for a full three months and the early signs of operating results from the organization working towards common goals and initiatives are very encouraging
we are over halfway through our a hundred days of marketing campaign and are pleased with the results
while we continue to see strong interest from various lending sources to finance our mh and rv assets the combination of several factors is contributing to additional scrutiny by lenders as they evaluate opportunities
assessing what our expectations are for ffo what our obligations are in terms of
with close to one thousand pictures being uploaded and posted by customers and we're really focused on those marketing efforts to remind people to take advantage of the a hundred days of camping
while the transient component of our rv business only represents five percent of our overall revenue it is an important feeder for the rest of our rv business
these factors include market conditions post-brexit the amount of capacity life companies have as they come close to meeting their annual allocations and the appetite gses have for financing rv assets
for the year ten percent of our new and used home sales were existing renters buying the home they were living in and an additional five percent of our sales were from customers who were already living in the community and chose to purchase a different home in the community
as we announced earlier in the year we no longer sell our paint products to mitre ten new zealand and are now aligned with bunnings in big box hardware retailing in new zealand the transition occurred later in the year and resulted in a modest decline in profit for the new zealand business
and finally our small southeast asian business grew ebit with growth in vietnam a key driver
the footprint of the factory is approximately the size of two very large bunnings stores
because it was only a few years ago we had ten percent share of the new housing market so we're not just going to chase share for share's sake
impact per se in terms of our strategy of looking to hold our overall ebit margins it's just one of the variables
you may recall that new zealand is around ten percent of segment ebit we were pleased that this impact was absorbed within the overall segment result
we've purchased a seventeen-hectare site and as you can see from the map we expect to use just under half of this area for the new factory
and around seventy percent of which are over twenty years old with high levels of homeownership and the strong emotional connection to the home we continue to see that our consumers invest in brands and products they trust
these sectors in the market overall have being weak in f 'fifteen and the outlook is that they will remain weak for f 'sixteen with the emerging pipeline of civil construction projects
this investment has a positive npv and strong financial payback driven by the cost savings associated with having a single site
and what we've really done in particularly the last twelve to eighteen months is launched a whole array of new products so now we don't just have our panel lift door and our more premium panel lift icon door
but we also see the power of physical marketing and our new studio d concept which we've opened as a pop up in melbourne with our dulux business is an example of how we are continually innovating in our decorative paints business
clearly the transitional issues that impacted the first half of f 'fifteen were disappointing however we do believe that the opportunity for growth in this business remains very strong and that we are well placed to deliver
from a cost perspective we've already mentioned that we restructured the parchem business in f 'fifteen some of the details are outlined on the slide but we believe that we have achieved savings and increased business capability at the same time
we have provided some specific guidance about the transitional impact of the exit of dulux paints from mitre ten in new zealand particularly in the first half
on page fourteen you can see the breakdown of the revenue you can see that
and then the second question is regarding the va i understand from some -- from talks with some of your competitors that there is sometimes
i think the one where we still benefit a lot from an inorganic component on the retail side is in germany where we've acquired a larger chain with fifty stores which was still fully in the inorganic side
unfortunately and i think we were pretty clear on that when we talked about marvel in may at the capital market we will not get the marvel into the va contract at this term
an exception with the va where if you bring a significant product you can actually enter
on page six as the ones who had a chance to come to capital markets day heard me say no change in the principal strategy of sonova we like our vertically integrated business model
a quick recap on the four growth drivers we shared at the strategy discussion
a significant investment into the high-growth developing markets before we get later into the numbers just a little bit our reporting as well as organizational structure restructured in three businesses
so please if you correct that in your notes it's still a good asp increase
some form of an otc product and if it is just to upsell people so that's certainly close to home and you would probably do with some form of brand from ourselves
i think after five years of leadership for the cochlear implant business being -- sitting here in switzerland
of why we like the progress of the business over the last years and also the last twelve months since i'm here
we've seen an unprecedented high number of preorders at uha we also have seen in the following launch events in all the different countries we are selling in
they are not a pain nor do you need to take any precautionary measures when you go for an mri so that late launch will obviously have an impact into how we think about the second half for the cochlear implant business
where are we right now and where do we go to and it considers the entire form factor that is launched excluding the va business that we have not yet launched it in so tom it's not just top of the line
i don't foresee any significant other changes on that level i think it's fair to say that over the last twelve months we have made some new assignments on people who are leading countries
looking next at new contracts within corecivic safety in july we began receiving offenders from the city of mesa arizona at our central arizona florence correctional complex under a three-year contract
the new contract has an initial term of two years and is renewable for additional periods by mutual agreement
for new contracts to be awarded ice will likely have to issue a formal request for proposal
through october and the first week of november we have continued to see increased occupancy levels from ice
at the federal level future needs include ice demand of up to three thousand beds pursuant to a request for information ice just published last month
enables you to calculate our estimated effective income tax rate of five percent to six percent and provides you with our estimate of total depreciation and interest expense
on this call we will discuss certain non-gaap measures a reconciliation of the most comparable gaap measurement is provided in our corresponding earnings release and included in the supplemental financial data on the investors page of our website
the original rfp was also seeking a potential county jail addition to the existing facility in order to replace the county's existing jail in downtown chattanooga
the bureau continues to project a need for additional bed capacity for the private sector and is progressing through the process as part of the car xix procurement
the process for nominating and receiving senate confirmations for new us attorneys continues to move forward these individuals of course are the nation's principal litigators that operate under the direction of the attorney general
but more importantly ice will likely also need congress to increase their annual appropriations for detention and removal operations
as our average daily population of offenders from california actually increased by about a hundred offenders
of the three gsa properties i think it woke up lot of folks that own these assets or brokers that sell these assets
and then also no one single contract over ten percent we think we have diminished the risk that maybe worried investors here in the last couple of years
since joining corecivic in two thousand seven patrick has served in a number of critical leadership roles that have provided him with meaningful company-wide knowledge and experience while supporting and leading our efforts to grow and diversify our company
we worked with ice to adjust the contract to make the unused capacity available to other partners
as of the beginning of august all aspects of proposition fifty seven were in effect
our guidance continues to reflect a gradual increase of offenders from the state of ohio under a contract we signed in april for up to nine hundred ninety six offenders to be cared for at our northeast ohio correctional center
so we actually have had a lot of inbound interest here in a short period of time we've probably looked at probably twenty or thirty properties that have been on market or maybe off market for transactions
but we've really come to appreciate here in the last twelve months there is a lot of old antiquated facilities out there
although the facility never lost power we were fully prepared with backup diesel generators and had ample food supplies for our ice detainees
given the path and expected strength of the hurricane winds there was no need to relocate any of the inmates and detainees across the seven affected facilities
and their ability to address other critical infrastructure needs and we look forward to the announcement of this rfp by the end of the year
while this process plays out over the balance of the year and into twenty eighteen the average daily prison populations for the marshals service are expected to continue to gradually increase
continuing with ice the agency issued a request for information for either new or existing detention capacity of up to three thousand beds
over multiple economic cycles and governmental administrations that will span the ten-year term of the notes
in chile we have the recent openings of the office towers in our mall in concepcion with a leasing area around eleven thousand square meters
has already added a leasing area of around seven thousand square meters and has already inaugurated some of their first stores
please go on to slide five and we will review other relevant facts through the period
in this way and as we have mentioned in the previous slides the cost per risk was stable and at a lower level than seen in twenty seventeen as we can also see in the graph in the lower right side of the slide
now we will go on to slide thirteen please now we will see the evolution that ripley has had
of five point four percent in regards to the same quarter of twenty seventeen the improved performance was achieved thanks to a better management in sales and to more sales associated to the world cup
a sense of what can change so dramatically in the space of three months
or two to six months after that lumber was dropped on the lot and so you would see that particular cost line potentially having some pressure but i would tell you that we would expect to see some of those things offset by other decreases
to quarter and that's why we guide around twenty and we can see some quarterly volatility due to some of those other factors that you mentioned
the people that just don't want to live next door to a two-story with a bunch of kids and those buyers are out there
once again keep in mind that combined with a seventy percent generics penetration rate introduction of new generic drugs and price decreases reduced pharmacy's retail sales growth
during the second quarter we introduced a new brand of cosmetics nyx exclusive to our network and very popular with the younger clientele
during the second quarter we proposed various health-related initiatives to our customers such as information campaigns pertaining to the implementation of bill forty one and campaigns related to severe allergies
the rest it was really made of investment in the development of the training material for the new pos system that will be
such as higher labor expense for annual inflation and higher volume handled in our warehouse additional support to our new stores in the network and expense in it to improve the network performance
during the second quarter -- that's on slide six we have put forward many different marketing initiatives such as special weekly flyers where many door-crasher prices were announced
if you look back in a couple of years ago in fiscal 'fourteen your script
the quarter saw a very successful implementation of the new trid regulations in all our regions
of nineteen ninety five actual results and trends could differ materially from those set forth in such statements due to various risks uncertainties and other factors
of our annual report on form ten-k and as updated by our quarterly reports on form ten-q
period and about nine percent lower on a year-over-year basis we would expect activity to pick up as we progress further into the first quarter
our c three alliance also extends our solution and is a key differentiator for us with prospects and customers who are looking for more cooperation among vendors
the biggest contributor to our license revenue growth was add-on business existing customers recognize the exceptional value we provide in protecting their it infrastructure and are expanding with additional licenses and new products
reconcile those two different data points and where you're seeing leverage relative to maybe a quarter ago when you gave the initial guide
drive improvements and then in gdpr what is your current thinking in terms of timing of when that starts to drive additional purchases
we also displaced a large legacy vendor in a us civilian agency the vast majority of our new business deals are still greenfield but it's rewarding when prospects determine that our solution is a better strategic fit to secure their infrastructure
to having the approximately twenty conjur employees the majority of who are developers or in technical roles join the team this week
our second quarter non-gaap operating income guidance reflects the full run rate of the headcount increases we've made in the first quarter
one new win a consumer manufacturing company is integrating three of cyberark's products into what the customer identifies as an internet of things project
as well as dramatic momentum in apj i'm just back from our customer event in apj and based on my discussion with customers and partners i am confident there is significant untapped opportunity across the region
our interactions with existing customers and prospects increased dramatically again this year we conducted deep dive sessions with c-level executives to identify ways we could help them better secure their infrastructure
we have actually now during april already repaid more than half of the nineteen maturities it was a bond that was maturing that we have repaid
and iron ore partly or maybe even mainly because of the vale accident during q one iron ore prices have really spiked during this quarter
we have two main priorities when we look into operation the most important one is within safety
what i think as we said the last time we met that we are investing now in mobile to take up capacity with another a hundredoh oh zero tonnes and i think
so therefore in q one we had the somewhat higher price than we would have thought given that we got the better mix in q one in q two where we expect volumes to be higher we will also have a slightly worse mix from that point of view
so firstly your perception on that and then secondly can you talk about how you see your position in the market over the next two years considering new capacity coming online how you
our equipment revenue were up by thirteen percent and this is coming from much higher unitary price
but also improved average uptake on the arpu of next transactions that we are going to see
as always rigorous cost control throughout the organization is part of our dna this has been a key focus area for several years as this is one of the main reason why and how we remain competitive
it's in three years so we would probably say that it's in the lower part of the range and i would say probably as we speak now and what we know
are your expectation for putting this program into the cst location
and preparing for full rebranding of circle k and couche-tard in the cst network the rebranding this year will focus on markets where both brands are present today
taking all of this into account what would you say the pro forma ebitda is of the network now
now i'll touch on our most recent acquisition which we announced on july ten since we had the call two days ago i'll just go over the highlights
what are the critical steps and specifically with cst how do you see the entire integration playing out
the next questions come from mark petrie from cibc i think the first question was around tax rate and we've already addressed those so moving to the second question
it all starts with being in the right places today enlink is focused on five core areas the stack in central oklahoma
our cajun-sibon system brings much needed ngl supplies into the region and our expansive asset base serves these growing demand markets in customers
today we have one of the best positions in the stack both in terms of our infrastructure and diverse and active customer base
while rig count growth supports the spectrum of opportunity in central oklahoma and the permian the scale of the lng capacity in industrial consumption provides gas-related opportunities in louisiana
to have bidirectional capability and then taking that a step further maybe an update with regard to how you see the evolution of what's going to be downstream of everything that you're doing in the stack
of the five we signed -- one of them is with the public company but four of them were private equity backed company and so inherently the timing is a little bit uncertain because what those companies tend to do is to appraise their acreage and then they may explore a sale
maintaining a strong balance sheet is a priority for us and we are pleased with the recent recognition from moody's with their upgrade of our corporate family rating from ba two to ba one and the affirmation of a stable outlook
as you recall in our last earnings call we told you that the first quarter twenty seventeen would look a lot like fourth quarter twenty sixteen and that's right about where we landed
we expect that the majority of enlc's cash available for distribution growth in twenty seventeen we waited to the second half of the year in large part driven by segment profit growth on our oklahoma footprint
our next step is to take riptide to a two hundred million a day plant
as i think about all that is underway at enlink today and the progress we've achieved i see three main keys to our success
and it's these three keys to success that i believe are important to take away from our discussion today enlink is in the right places with the right partners and is executing with excellence
as a growing midstream service provider it's critical to be where the activity is and today more than half of the total us rigs are located in the stack and permian basins
leading producers in the stack are testing spacing profiles in the multiple landing zones of the meramec and woodford formations as well as evaluating the osage oswego and sycamore formations
in oklahoma we team with over twenty producer customers and we are one of the only midstream companies that has commercial agreements in place with the vast majority of major producers
we brought our chisholm ii gas plant into service increasing processing capacity by two hundred million cubic feet a day in the stack and added incremental customers and contracts to our expanding business there
the way our stack system is configured our high pressure gathering frontline generally gathers from the west towards the chisholm plant in the east
we don't have perfect clarity on that where we are today one thing we need to resolve is our ngl solution in oklahoma so that we understand
we see the potential for that but we need to see what our ngl solution is going to look like out of oklahoma
our objective with the entyce launch was to leverage the experience that we gained in launching nocita and galliprant and we are pleased to report this morning that we believe we have achieved initial success on that objective
and the primary quantitative metric by which we're measuring interest is the number of clinics that have ordered entyce and we are pleased to be well ahead of our objective on that metric
at any rate we believe that veterinarians are very excited to have entyce in their toolbox and we are very pleased to see veterinarians using the therapeutic tool
we believe that we have strategically balanced our direct sales organization with distributors to optimize the early entyce commercial efforts
we are also aware that veterinarians are frustrated with their treatment options in cats and some veterinarians are treating cats with entyce even now
we are pleased to have more than doubled our goal for the fourth quarter of two thousand seventeen in terms of accounts that ordered product and we continue to be very pleased with the rate at which we are adding accounts
we believe that the long-term success of entyce will be driven by veterinarians become increasingly comfortable with its use
i mentioned during the last results call that we had expected to see seasonal softness in nocita sales given our expectation at that time
while the payments received from this therapeutic during the clinical study will be very modest in two thousand eighteen we are pleased to have advanced to this phase
we are also working directly with several national and regional corporate customers we believe that entyce is well represented in the clinics and we are having success in defining and building this new therapeutic category
and we are certainly already seeing reorders during the first quarter of two thousand eighteen we continue to see move-out into the clinics at approximately the same rate as what we saw in the first month
i will discuss the early experience with entyce in more detail in a few moments
about their experience with entyce so we believe that our enthusiasm for entyce is shared by veterinarians and pet owners and the primary quantitative metric by which we are measuring interest
as we get further into twenty eighteen we anticipate that inventory levels across the channel will stabilize and we will see more robust sequential growth and a tighter correlation between shipments to distributors and move-out to clinics
now that we are approximately one year into the launch we believe the inventory in the sales channel has stabilized
which may place the achievement of the milestone into two thousand and nineteen we anticipate we will finance the company's needs as appropriate with
in 'seventeen so if we think about 'eighteen what's a reasonable kind of gross profit
our strategy in this area is all about leveraging the versatile and adaptable g one platform in ways that allow us to bring new technologies to the market faster while expanding our market share
additional information will be available when we file our form ten-q with the securities and exchange commission
we continue to take cost out of our products and find new ways to add value through technology with the integrated tic being a prime example
overall the fundamentals and key drivers of msa's business are starting to point in the right direction
please member that msa does not give guidance and that precludes most discussion related to our expectations for future sales and earnings having said that we will now open up the call for your questions
maybe not twenty plus percent like we were able to see last year but we still have good solid expectations for fall protection in this business
look at the g one and to identify the great features of it and features that they think they could improve upon
looking closer at our first quarter results in core products we saw a three percent decline in constant currency compared to a year ago
over the life of the scba which is obviously a key value proposition for us
despite the challenging comparison in revenue in the first quarter resulting from large scba and ballistic helmet orders a year ago we saw strong improvements in the -- in some of the most profitable areas of our business in the quarter
well i think that the -- our experience in developing the g one was that it took a very significant amount of investment
the order performance in all three of those categories as well as i think you suggested the backlog was up at the end of the first quarter
our overall fall protection backlog was about forty percent higher at the end of the first quarter
our associates around the world live by msa's core values every day and at the center of this culture is our foundational core value of integrity
despite some of the challenges we faced in the quarter on the top line as ken indicated we were able to grow adjusted earnings by twenty four percent and drive higher levels of free cash flow i was really pleased by this
and took us five years to bring that to market with the amount of voice of customer research that we did in order to hit the bull's eye the way we did
if you have not already done so we encourage you to download the quarterly report on form ten-q and the slides to use on this call
moving to slide seven we recently launched the new syniverse brand as the world's most connected company
favorable results in terms of the mts growth portfolio and that's an example of a new product introduction and new innovation on data analytics
today's call will also include a discussion of certain non-gaap measures including adjusted ebitda and free cash flow you will find a reconciliation of each of these items as well as other information about our use of these non-gaap measures
moving to slide five we are expanding our offerings in the ways in which we go to market to serve our customers as the new syniverse and that includes partnerships
these declines were mostly offset by another strong quarter of growth in our eis business as well as our mts growth products
our capital spending during the first nine months of two thousand and eighteen continued to be primarily focused on enhancing existing
kind of unique customer dynamics that actually happened in the third quarter of last year when this eu roaming regulation actually went into effect
moving to slide twelve let's take a look at our free cash flow calculation for the nine months ended september thirty and i'll close with some balance sheet comments
we probably had more of an impact in two thousand and seventeen but we do still have products
we start from a set of unique strengths that we still have despite the tough market environment they include the fact that i believe now after two and a half years in the business that we have one of the most powerful brands in the business
to add new restaurants to the royalty pool so this year on january one pizza pizza limited added restaurants that had
in discussions with the fda and we'll very soon be able to finalize
revenues and expenses included in ifrs basis next slide this shows the positive and negative factors on each business impacting our revenue in the first quarter
i am sure you would agree that without the agreement of the fda we will not be able to release any data before the study is completed in two years
the medical community has also recognized the profound breakthrough that spinraza represents for the treatment of sma patients with two publications in the new england journal of medicine the most just a few weeks ago
consistent with our goal of being a multiproduct profitable company we project twenty eighteen will be our third consecutive year of pro forma operating profitability
we have a detailed publication and medical education plan mapped out for the next eighteen months to support the global launch
we significantly exceeded our improved financial guidance for twenty seventeen and ended the year in the strongest financial position in the company's history
up twenty five percent last year with no indication that growth is slowing yet this year
let's turn to page eleven northstar portfolio performance i want to reiterate from previous calls that we evaluate each business at the contribution margin level
i guess five or six weeks in gettington and just give us a sort of
turning to page seven you'll see the things we're focusing on in response to these challenges
we experienced a a hundred basis point deterioration in marketing leverage during the first quarter although we adjusted our marketing spend in response to soft sales demand we were unable to fully offset the lower response rates on our marketing campaigns
we did see a sixty basis point improvement in credit operating cost during the quarter
some sort of guidance be that as revenue or ebitda with respect to any or all of your
and you see it -- you see that behavior kind of going right through zero right because the margin book continues to grow as well so customers even getting more comfortable borrowing we see new entrants into the margin book
for the roughly one million relationships coming on board tca has been part of the family for about three months now and the transition has been exceptionally smooth our new business momentum continues just as we put the strength of our brand behind it
increase is largely driven by a timing difference between our recent june debt issuance and the redemption of our trup securities
at levels that tca historically wouldn't participate right so call it in the hundreds of millions of dollars rather than the tens to a hundred million in terms of players a lot of that has to do with
historically there's been about a fifteen percent keep of the assets that come through us on a year basis as they vest and flow through those accounts
i would expect that we will go through where we are on the four growth metrics that we put out there but remember that those growth -- the growth goals we put out were really client business metrics
and very importantly we continued to reap the benefits of our optionshouse acquisition now nearly two years post deal closed driving improved metrics and expending the platform and offerings to our most active trading client base
for early extinguishment of debt in q three associated with the redemption of the trups the vast majority of which were redeemed earlier this week
we'll be there on tuesday march thirteen to meet with investors and present investment highlights and so now i'll turn the call over to randy
for those of you who may be interested in exploring this further we published a market update in our website on january twenty three that provides our perspective on the rapidly evolving fcev car market
i don't think we want to a give specific number at this point one thing that's important this year is is regardless of the actual production volume is to validate the production capacity of twenty thousand stacks per year
by moving to more shifts and also getting that second automated line operational so when we talk about production capacity for twenty thousand i personally believe that's a very conservative production capacity number
in terms of twenty eighteen outlook in europe we expect increased market activity during the year related to fuel cell electric buses which we expect will result in the growth of purchase orders for modules
within technology solutions we worked on over thirty programs in the year many of which randy mentioned earlier
last year specifically related to the completion of that joint venture ts program
we believe ballard is the first publicly traded fuel cell company to achieve positive adjusted ebitda for an entire fiscal year
we are now transitioning to supply relationship with the jv based on our take-or-pay agreement for the supply by ballard of any age to the joint venture
for five engines to power buses in palm desert and those engines were shipped last year
technology solutions also benefited from revenue associated with the ts program with partners in china as we implemented key elements of our supply chain strategy for that market
how orders get processed under milestone c which was a first time for going through that process for us
a recent report from the hydrogen council profiled the development stage of many of these fcev applications
simple as five hundred commercial trucks being deployed in shanghai all using the same converters and the same stacks and the same modules
a number of the systems integrators and potential partners in that market we've had very good progress with over the last six months in particular the other thing that's really important is we've been working
while the q two numbers were soft we are seeing some green shoots which give us confidence that we'll see improvement in the back half
let me now turn it over to brian to discuss our q two performance in more detail thanks irene and good morning before i get into the quarter let me provide more details on the malware incident and where we currently stand in our recovery
over the past four weeks we've worked tirelessly to restore our systems and recover from the disruption
let me now turn to our regional performance we continue to see solid trends underlying the results in three of our four regions
driven by the lower trade stock levels associated with dsd as we've said this is also the market where we had the majority of our lost consumption due to the july four holiday timing
as well as milka in china which continued to perform well approximately sixty percent of our year-to-date revenue grew or held share in this category
we continue to expect to deliver double-digit eps growth for the full year
as you think about your models for the next two quarters remember that q four is seasonally a higher revenue quarter
yes look there's no question as we think about the second half so you can do the math on what we need to do in the second half to get to at least one that's still -- we need a good second half
he's lived and worked on three continents and has proven his ability to drive growth on both the top and bottom lines
those places that we're getting the best return to work with our customers to understand the roi of some of the various promotional practices that are going on
but i will tell you we are seeing early success and part of the challenge is we've been talking about this for quite some time they announced six to nine months ago and we told you what we were going to do and now we're actually about doing it so we have every confidence
slightly down from where we were in the first half of last year but roughly in the range of where we've been as we look at the last six quarters or so
manufacture our products and serve customer needs given the timing of the attack we experienced meaningful disruption in our ability to ship and invoice during the last four days of the quarter
our white space chocolate expansion and gains in displays and shelf space as we capitalize on our competitor's transition out of its dsd network
for the last four days of the quarter and into the third quarter we had limited ability to ship and invoice customers in many markets
you'll note that we're absorbing the dilution from the two divestitures but we're also adjusting our outlook for interest expense for the year and the two items roughly offset one another
i'm indebted to my ninety thousand colleagues around the world who have worked tirelessly to deliver their commitments each and every day in the face of many challenges
by now i'm sure you've seen our two press releases and you're all googling furiously so before we discuss our second quarter results let me take a few minutes to talk about my decision to retire and our plans for ceo succession
it has been the honor of a lifetime to serve as chairman and ceo of this great company
dirk will become ceo effective in november and i look forward to continuing to serve as chairman of our board until the end of the first quarter next year to ensure a smooth transition
maintaining significant buffer over minimum levels in the course of two thousand and eighteen but we expect that this comfort level for us
the need of vtb to comply with the regulatory ratios and banks are different from all other state companies because they do need to comply with the regulatory capital ratios
and we hope to be able to make the fid on the infrastructure shortly
a recent development is that the has taken measures to import lng by signing an agreement with equatorial guinea
at zero for the first half of this year we are very pleased with this result it's also a kpi that our clients pay a lot of attention to and we of course
large volumes of lng available at competitive prices
this is only done if the first two options don't provide a better solution
gross margin rate performance to increase ten to fifteen basis points we would expect more significant improvement in the first quarter with the remainder of the year with very modest improvement
in the fourth quarter where it underperformed actually the most of all of our six business categories and also for the year where it was similar in terms of underperformance and
i'll start today's call by walking through our financial results and then kevin will provide an operational update and our thoughts on twenty seventeen we'll then open up the call to your questions
and i can't point to the fourth quarter of last year as a massive improvement there because we spent more on marketing and we actually did fewer sales so you're one hundred percent right on that but we do see
at the close of business on march eight i'll now turn it over to kevin who will provide some additional insights on our results
and those two facts really help inform how we look going forward at stores
and finally our localization efforts now impact about eighty five percent of our assortment and are having a positive impact on sales as well as reducing inventory levels at the same time
moving on to our focus on store optimization as you know we made a decision to close eighteen stores last year with most closing in june
would be to try to get to at a cost basis of closer to four percent over the course of time i'm not going to burden the new cfo with that expectation but i think if you go back and look at some of our statistics
for a year and some of the customers actually were with us for two years as they were part of our pilot group so i think michelle and the rest of the marketing team have done a good job
our credit portfolio typically operating with closer to two times leverage so i would expect to see our portfolio leverage decrease over time as we increase our allocation to residential credit
market reflection of where they think short-term libor is going over the twelve months but during that twelve-month period for those particular
from my perspective i would like to briefly point out what i believe are the three-bullet-point takeaways from our activities during the third quarter
these and other risks uncertainties and factors including those discussed under the heading risk factors in our annual report on form ten-k and other reports that we file
whose coupon rates adjust to market interest rates within the next twelve months and annually thereafter
we do think that the new rules of ecb may represent an opportunity for compass because
condition precedent like a cp like in a contract saying that we wanted to do it only provided that we should have found a very robust and sound
use and satisfaction with our stapling and energy products has been rising as gen four products have increased in the installed base
with growth led by hysterectomy we continue to see an increasing proportion of us gynecology procedures being performed by physicians that specialize in complex benign and cancer surgery who tend to be users of da vinci systems
while a proportion of vats remained virtually unchanged during the study period the robotic rate grew as open declined
product cycles and competitive factors within this framework we'd expect twenty eighteen capital placement seasonality to generally follow historical patterns by quarter
this month the ministry of health in japan listed for reimbursement twelve procedures in which da vinci could be used in addition to prostatectomy and nephrectomy which are already reimbursed
with nearly three hundred systems installed in japan the level of system expansion over the year or so -- over the next year or so is difficult to predict
as our business strengthened we increased some investment through twenty seventeen to strengthen our corporate infrastructure and position us to benefit from increased scale
preliminary results were reported at the chest conference in q four of twenty seventeen feedback from physicians evaluating our technology relative to existing and emerging alternatives has been strongly supportive of our efforts
in q one we expect a modest procedure headwind compared to q one twenty seventeen as a result of our estimates of working days mostly due to the timing of the good friday holiday
japan is a great example of thinking through how do you do these tam calculations because we'll see what the mix is with regard to laparoscopy versus
note that in the future as the irs issues additional guidance and interpretation of the new tax law our estimated rate may be impacted
and so we did see a number of customers in europe trade out their sis for x product
our voluntary personal lines policies increased by almost four thousand policies during the quarter
massachusetts and rhode island were filed maybe sixty days ago and we are working with those departments
which was the same as the second quarter of twenty fourteen the current quarter's loss ratio was favorably impacted by the inclusion of commercial residential business and favorable prior quarter development
the acquisition of zephyr insurance is expected to close in the fourth quarter of twenty fifteen or the first quarter of twenty sixteen subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals
for two thousand and sixteen on january thirty one dan was hit by a vehicle while he was cycling and following the accident he was hospitalized for an extended period of time
we have won major body camera contracts with our first three state patrols which we believe was enabled knowing that we have a compatible in-car solution coming to market
with our existing axon capabilities we have been able to reduce the time it takes to redact one hour of video
with nearly two patrol cars for every three officers and the increasingly positive feedback from our trials we see the axon fleet in-car camera as a tremendous opportunity to extend our capabilities
since the event dan has not been able to act in his cfo capacity and he will likely not be returning we are thankful that he has now been released from the hospital and he is now recuperating at home and is expected to make a full recovery
these two strategic investments will highly differentiate our offering in a way that no one else can deliver and can create a highly defensible platform that will continue to pull further ahead of our competition
in half from eight hours using other solutions to four hours using our solution today we expect to reduce that time from four hours down to just ninety minutes by the end of this year with our new ai feed and capabilities
thanks rick we had an exceptionally strong fourth quarter and full year twenty sixteen and i am proud to share the highlights of our accomplishment
we had several notable bookings in q four as we continue to consolidate the market louisiana state police went with full deployment on the axon platform on our unlimited plan for all officers
longer term we see the opportunity for the axon segment hardware margins in the fifty percent range as service plan upgrades start to kick in
we spent the last two years really revamping our whole structure going much more with a direct sales force
we intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbor provided by the private securities litigation reform act of nineteen ninety five the forward-looking information is based upon current information and expectations regarding taser international
in doing so we are moving forward aggressively with the implementation of ai technology to help our customers make use of all the data that they are recording while significantly reducing their workload
all three are critical and we now have achieved a uniquely powerful combination of these three elements
this will represent a huge savings in time and resources and within the next five years we believe that number could drop to zero as ai does all of the work without requiring any human interaction
this is where our ecosystem of devices software and users now powered by ai will be a game changer
was six x up from four point nine x in the prior quarter on higher bookings we view this ratio as one of the key operating metrics used by management to evaluate the effectiveness and validation of our strategy
please note that the anticipated sequential increase in q one operating expenses is in addition to the expenses relating to our two recent artificial intelligence acquisitions
our company's advantages in ai aren't just somewhat better than our competitors it's structurally superior all systematic incentives for progress in ai for us are aligned towards deepening our market lead in users
our ai tools will extract the information for the police record system and in the future that we are building records will be recorded not written
we continue to add users to the axon platform and ended the year with almost ninety five thousand active paid licenses
for further analysis using our data with npi-c and as well as some of the other tools that we use in our study
the data in more depth particularly related to their questions to assess the potential risks associated with future development of the d five program so it has taken us a little bit longer
of course our future burn rate will be dependent on whether we partner the d five technology
as well as the t four technology and perhaps any cost associated with the development of sarm or any new license technology that we have this year so looking ahead
over the past six months the company has explored multiple refinancing alternatives to ensure we would achieve the best possible terms with the right long-term partners
at retailers such as cvs and walgreens we also recently announced a new partner for the brand in several home fragrance categories and one continues to be a key performer
we continue to focus on our six core brands that represent eighty percent of our business
this was a great opportunity to showcase the and one brand with top young players wearing our sneakers
we are on track to launch a fragrance and color cosmetics line later this year and hair and skin care in twenty nineteen joe's continues to show strength domestically as well as internationally
the premium a one by and one collection is on track to launch in specialty stores and boutiques later this year
holiday dressing and an extended assortment of tops and bottoms qvc continues to be a great platform for us to introduce and test new product categories
and other risks detailed from time to time in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission including the quarterly report on form ten-q and the annual report on form ten-k
so what are the next key steps in our strategic plan to turn around this company and let's focus just on three our first step is to hire five new sales reps as fast as possible
so i covered just a few thoughts and our numbers for the quarter ending september thirty two thousand sixteen spent a few minutes on our recent transaction with invekra and how this transaction fits into our overall corporate strategy
we've lined up a strong product pipeline to be launched over the next twelve months with about one new product launch
we will continue to manufacture at cost for invekra until they can establish their own manufacturing facility which we estimate to take about three to six months
we feel that oculus is in the best shape that we've ever been in for two reasons one oculus has effectively executed a turnaround strategy in a very attractive dermatology market
and so -- and then obviously hire them so we're going to start doing that right away and we think that we can as jim mentioned hire an additional five fairly quickly in the january timeframe
our table win was down a little more than seven percent table drop was down just over three percent but our hold percentage was also down about a point compared to last year leading to the revenue decline
from the fact that the thursday and friday of our sister company's nascar weekend fell in the third quarter this year and also from lower convention rooms compared to last year
our slot win was fairly close to the fourth quarter of last year it was down a little more than one percent mgm opened in the national harbor on december eight and while they may have a had a small effect on the numbers for the balance of the month
a lower table game hold percentage extremely lucky sports betting patrons lower convention volume and the changed timing of our sister company's nascar race weekend and the higher health care cost across the board as denis mentioned
in q two we've continued to demonstrate our ability to efficiently operate
during q two we signed a number of new customer contracts and continued to see a growing pipeline of new opportunities driven by both our direct and indirect sales channels by way of example
to work in concert with their office devices we believe we are well positioned to strongly compete for market share in the smb voip category
we also continued to identify potential areas for cost reductions to maximize cash flow from the consumer business in q two we launched an aggressive initiative to overhaul customer care
so we're trying to convert those folks just as we tried and were successful in converting about two percent more or less of the app users who were using the service for free
regarding our ongoing focus on cost controls we've continued to identify areas of additional cost savings in q two including the reduction in termination expense through elimination of our free voice app calling
a lower price for a number of blocks in canada we're getting rid of a monthly minimum that we were stuck with for many many years because the contract was i think over three years in duration
things that really don't cost us very much money like a power bank on five-year plan where there is extraordinary margins on that so
our second quarter financial performance was highlighted by strong ebitda and operating cash flow in our consumer business
long-time customers in that group and they tend to sign three- to five-year contracts so there's a good amount of stability in the customer base
over the past five years we've been expanding and strengthening our platform
it probably doesn't make us it doesn't make sense for us to own the long term so i would see us in two or three years not this year
certainly the success we've had at four hundred west georgia gives us confidence that there's a lot of demand
we have advanced work on the remaining buildings with the goal of coming to grade through q two twenty nineteen we have tendered the majority of the work for the project
i remain confident in the preliminary plan you will recall that the first step is to propel noi growth over the next five years
there will be i think a contribution coming from four sixty eight in twenty twenty but it will simply be a bit of a drag on us
i think there are two things and we've experienced this before
a number that we should look at only because i think there's some sort of maybe bonus type stuff in q four or is that a good
mario i think the most material of those three anticipated
but i do think one way you can defend against it is by having the kind of properties that we tend to focus on
turning to the breakdown of operations slide seven you can observe that
will see some sort of improvement in that fixed broadband arpu trend i mean there must be a lot of customers on promotional pricing at the moment
european north and eastern us as one of the more challenged market areas but i think it fundamentally has not changed the way that we look at the business on that
and we had a fairly high turnaround season i think in china and that's coming back so i think that that supply may impact that but generally asia feels better than it did probably three or four months ago
most of that was the commodity and the primary variance would be the arb on the lpg exports that we were expecting at the time when
we expect our capex to be lower in two thousand and sixteen and return to more historical levels now that our forest product expansion is complete
in addition some of our comments may reference non-gaap financial measures a reconciliation of the most directly comparable gaap financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and on our website
turning to slide five we continued to see gains in key specialty product lines in the first quarter
i'll also expand on a few of our key achievements in twenty sixteen and discuss how they contribute to vermillion's self-funded growth and income model
subject to unexpected changes in the commodity price outlook we plan to discontinue the premium drip beginning with the july twenty seventeen dividend payment such that there would be no further equity issuance under this program
now ranking ninth on the future forty responsible leaders in canada list the highest ranking for an oil and gas company
more detailed information on our reserves and resources can be found in our aif and reserves press release issued this morning
we achieved these strong operational results while preserving the strength of our balance sheet and maintaining our dividend in twenty sixteen over our fourteen-year history of paying a dividend we have increased our dividend three times and have never reduced it
this morning we announced another twenty five percent proration in our premium drip program with the april twenty seventeen dividend payment such that eligible shareholders who have elected to participate in the
these measures associated with our drips will further reduce share issuance ensuring that future growth and production reserves and ffo more efficiently flows to our owners on a per share basis
more details on this reallocation of capex in production by business unit can be found in our march twenty seventeen investor presentation which is currently posted on our website
due to the improvement in our project slate we believe that most of these cost and efficiency gains are durable over the long term with respect to twenty seventeen services costs we note that a significant majority of our capital costs are locked in for the year
at one point we had five segments and it was very difficult to focus on what we needed to do
was recorded in the third quarter of two thousand and fifteen as a result of notification by the epa that buckhorn is considered a potentially responsible party in connection with the new idria mercury mine site
our big ag customers are doing and one of the things that's kind of striking is is that there's never been a time where there's been three bad years in agriculture
rolling the whole budget together for 'sixteen yet but as we think about the various moving parts it sounds like we should see some
it looks as though there will be a very high level of launches in two thousand and sixteen we also expect to see increased sales from recent and upcoming new product and service introductions
these agreements follow an earlier contract we announced in september of a binding heads of terms agreement with areva inc which will form the basis of the joint venture operating agreement
announced that it's going to be applying to the nrc to extend the life of its license on a reactor here in virginia from forty years to sixty years
today we announced three binding agreements with areva np these contracts form the foundation for
dividends or other income from a fifty percent equity stake in the joint venture company with areva the strong support we have witnessed from areva is further validation of our technology
the joint venture operating agreement is the last remaining agreement that needs to be signed to complete our joint venture arrangement with areva inc
is an ongoing one as you indicated it's very important to us because it gives us two things that we really need to have as we continue to develop the fuel it gives us the
all of the details by the way are available on the form four s that we filed to disclose all of the details to grants to officers and directors and i would like to add that most of these grants are performance-based grants
and they believe that they have vet it thoroughly in technical space so between ourselves and areva we are quite confident that the fuel is going to work
and the nrc license is the single best thing we could get to bring overseas to expedite licensing from other agencies so we're not
really think that it would help us in terms of a time line to try to get this licensed in another country because the nrc would probably want to see the same kind of testing that we already plan to be doing
and i understood you correctly to one of the previous questions that the official goal for the guidance is to improve the adjusted ebit margin because you can't control what's coming below
that started to ship in june we believe given the six-month time frame provided we will be able to sell out a significant portion of that capacity in the form of parent rolls and retail sales with margins comparable to or better than currently achieved
you will find videos that compare the performance of our qrt ultra products to comparable tad ultra products
the qrt technology in the barnwell facility continues to improve from a product and process development perspective the paper machine is being ramped up as sales dictate to ensure good working capital management
management believes that these non-gaap measures provide incremental information useful in understanding the cash flows and operating performance of the company the ebitda measurements are also required and evaluated by our lenders
and strength relative to comparable basis weight tad kitchen towel products while maintaining standards for feel
we're very proud of the progress the fedex team has made in recovering from the effects of the cyberattack at tnt let me express our appreciation to the thousands of fedex professionals
i'd like to take this opportunity to thank our more than four hundred thousand team members around the world who are continuing to work hard to deliver the holidays during the home stretch of the season
having said that it won't go up as much as eps because of what i said about capex i hope that gives you the color that you need
now as i mentioned already we have more than ten thousand fedex onsite locations and we are very very pleased with the usage trends that we have seen so far thank you
and some of the questions seem to miss those two points and i want to reemphasize that our great service is because of the
it would be bringing the money forward and not spending it later it's the capex for gdp growth rates
and they're -- and we've driven more than one million miles on these on the road so we know that they're safer
revenue and earnings growth in the second half of fiscal twenty eighteen our plans remain on target to improve operating income at the fedex express segment
for greater profitability in periods beyond fy 'twenty a portion of the incremental integration expenses relates to establishing a new international corporate structure
improving the security posture reliability and speeding up the integration of the technology platforms we've been successful on all three fronts
because of the investments we've made these automated facilities that henry talked about we have two major hubs coming online next year and a couple more
did a survey prior to this tax bill passing and eighty two percent of the brt membership anticipated that if it did pass
as we have discussed in the past we expect our new product development effort to deliver about a hundred basis points organic volume growth per annum
our mill operations are highly integrated with our converting platform as we consume over eighty five percent of the paperboard we produce
gauge the impact of that announcement is this maybe another leg-up for occ or is china just kind of confirming something that they've been doing already for most of the year
carton craft will allow us to integrate more of our cuk paperboard tons into a growing air filter frame market and will provide a runway for further margin improvement
on the cost curve that you would then look to implement in crb take the form more in terms of trying to find lower-cost
looking ahead we remain confident that we will see significant positive benefit from these pricing actions in two thousand and eighteen we also expect our cost models to benefit
such factors include those that have in the past and may in the future be identified in the company's sec filings and other public announcements
but they hadn't done a lot of consolidation so if you'll remember in toronto alone they still had three different facilities
we've moved aggressively to rightsize the organization and expect ote to return to profitability over the second half of our fiscal
with respect to our guidance for fiscal 'sixteen we -- and assuming the economy continues to hold
this may well be kind of a one step backwards so we can take two steps forward in getting the realization of some of the strategic benefits of the line-haul
and as you know over the last three years fleetwood has been substantially restructured
so if i could ask you to just turn ahead one slide now to village operations and while as you probably know that twenty eighteen financial year was the best
i'd also note that we use both gaap and non-gaap measures and we refer you to our reconciliation of these measures
so just wanted to know the sort of story behind these comments why do you say that there is a concern on demand where no other fmcg has
now what we think is going to happen next year is there'll be very modest improvement throughout the year particularly in the second half of 'seventeen but i caution we think it's modest
were we have been increasing our investments in these last two years in spite of fx and energy headwinds it's important to continue to do that in the business we have a
selling time productivity as we go forward so that's an area that's getting a lot of work we continue to invest in just core erp capabilities
we don't think this is by any means set up for a v recovery i'm talking about the overall energy market
and fx has really been the problem that's been the most challenging for us to negate because it's not going to justify any pricing or drive any pricing in the market raw materials
momentum as we go in so yes it's going to take a little while to build this business back and regain the twenty percent we lost
longer term there's probably two key areas that we're going to have outsize emphasis one i just talked about in terms of
in twenty sixteen's difficult operating environment we have focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs
and we'd rather be two weeks late than two weeks early on that recovery because it's so hard to predict
business but the seven which also included swisher i would say is artificially low
so what's encouraging about the slide if you look at the big three opcos sa nigeria and iran
or in all is delivered through an it system or digital platform so there's no success for us without success in the world of technology
up fourteen percent the data revenues were boosted by the significant network additions that we saw in the year the subscriber growth that we saw in key markets
increased in the year to two point seven times now as we look over the medium term we would like to see the holding company leverage
so this is about stimulating usage in high consumer urban areas ip TV customers
i have now three slides on digital just to unpack that in a little bit more detail than we did in the half year
so i think we've built a wonderful foundation it's deployed across fourteen markets and growth in the future will come from rapid scaling within those markets introducing new markets
data traffic growth of sixty percent in the year and that was in the back of the sustained investment in the network that we took
so that's the reason why we have the big focus around cbn across our key markets now turning over to expenses
underneath that there are five very key elements and the first one that i want to focus on is that we have a strong position in the right markets
and we also had professional fees coming through to support the delivery of the ignite program
digital revenues as i mentioned earlier on these were impacted by the vast optimization work that we undertook in twenty seventeen resulting in the revenue contraction that you saw in the key markets such as nigeria
looking at cash flow the chart shows the reported ebitda evolution into operating free cash flow and then the utilization of that cash generated
and i hope you enjoyed the little video that we opened with which was just trying to give you a feel for what we've been up to the last twelve months a lot of time on
and this was despite the weaker macro and tough fx environment in key markets
iran and saudi we have a strong position in iran so we are represented in three of the four largest economies across the region i think this is important to give people an exposure to the regions
range of between twenty percent and fifteen percent so that means of course that we intend to bring the group capex intensity down
the company's monitored home and personal security offerings have historically included a manufacturing installation and servicing of its own proprietary wireless two-way voice controller panels
but of course this is phase one for the second phase evaluate as we bring new capabilities to the market we work with our clients every day to help them understand the data and importantly how they can use the data to run their business
a new more broadly defined currency that represents more of the total audience across all screens and platforms not just the viewing that fits into the rules that define c three for television
a reasonable framework for how to think about your business in time for the twenty sixteen upfronts in time for the twenty sixteen upfronts and everybody is aligned around that interest everybody that came to our meeting last week
our streak of constant currency revenue growth has been extended to thirty seven consecutive quarters reflecting our consistency and resiliency through the cycles
in developed markets revenues were up about three percent in the first half of the year we saw modest growth in discretionary spend and that continued in the third quarter
watch margins expanded fifty seven basis points as we continue to drive productivity and operating leverage in the business our watch segment remains strong and our new products are gaining momentum
including reckitt benckiser our relationship with rb has deepened beyond consumer insights and expanded into an engagement that is focused on measurement strategy and technology
but they have so far not chosen to let that happen for their reasons and we respect those reasons we found an alternative approach to be able to measure viewing of video on demand through svod platforms that's been critically important to
we already report c three we already report c seven in fact in all of the data that goes out to the marketplace we have the capability to extend that even further so that's one dimension the other dimension is more about the breadth
they are making progress on the work that they need to do to fully take advantage of the new components for example look at cbs
it the future of measurement is a hybrid approach putting the two together having the best of both worlds
revenues in both us and international irrigation were modestly improved in the quarter while infrastructure revenues were substantially higher than the same quarter of last year
sales of road safety products in us increased modestly during the quarter over the same period last year
with various effective dates that extend through december two thousand nineteen however several states have moved or will be moving to the new standards before the required federal dates
we've already received letters of eligibility from fhwa for products tested and submitted for review and are in process of completing testing and preparing requests for eligibility of the next group of products
these factors were partially offset by about one point of unfavorable mix
and while our focus on traditional retailers remains core we are seeing strong progress in e-commerce where sales are up ahead of our objectives at more than thirty percent for the fiscal year having accelerated into the fourth quarter
we compete in nine major categories and in three of those nine private label is a major competitor such as to put it in perspective
and we had another strong year of innovation delivering about three points of incremental sales to the top line
and equally importantly i think we're feeling very good about the innovation we launched in 'seventeen that should carry over to fiscal 'eighteen so that's one piece of the assumption the second assumption is around pricing
now i'll turn it over to steve to provide more details on our fiscal 'seventeen performance
i think as we've said for many years we'd like to get that below fourteen percent we've done that and i think we feel good about it i think there's more opportunity here
if we think about q four we saw particularly strong consumption and sales in the core lip care
as well as outlook for fiscal year 'eighteen well thanks lisah and we're certainly very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year
these factors were partially offset by a hundred and thirty basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs from continued inflation
as we mentioned in our press release we anticipate sales growth in the range of two percent to four percent as always this reflects a number of assumptions including about three points of incremental sales growth from new products
consistent with our twenty twenty strategy we're responding to these challenges by continuing to invest strongly in product and brand differentiation to keep our value propositions sharp
there are three things i want you to take away from this call first i'm particularly proud of the more than eight thousand clorox people around the world
if you were to identify three to five things you think would really shape and evolve this industry or the industries you compete in and the way you think about your strategy what would you call out
for innovation even for distribution is quite good so you're just going to have to take it on faith that we've got good business plans and we're executing against it it doesn't mean we can't be wrong on the two percent to four percent outlook
based on how well the plant has been running the decision has been made to reduce the length of the upcoming september turnaround to twelve days
and lastly the additional contribution margin that we'll pick up from thirteen additional production days
we believe our second quarter uan prices will be much higher
this was driven by the lower uan and ag ammonia sales volumes previously discussed which were partially offset by the increased sales volumes of our industrial and mining products given our increased marketing efforts
so in this area also for our customers if you look at the carbide-based pvc some regulations are on
so for example i don't think that fifty gigawatt-hours exactly would be the right capacity but i think that you need to have some buffer so how much capex do you believe would be required to support that type of revenue
now for our company in terms of the batteries it belongs to lg chem we're not going to
and when you do the depreciation on that i think that you are looking at a useful life of six years as the bench -- rule of thumb but for your useful life
situation and so while we had a very good demand coming in two thousand and seventeen are we going to see correction in twenty eighteen this is something that we are looking into but we cannot be definitive but what we can share with you
and since the oil prices are rising during that period of time and the fourth quarter there is a lot of heating-related lpg demand
and in terms of whether we can go in the black in the second half of twenty eighteen that is our plan and we stand by our plan
the question was that in twenty twenty there is some talk about china getting rid of its subsidiaries
the targets for apomorphine are overlapping with aptiom customers so we don't anticipate significant increases in spending
in other regions meropen business was returned from astrazeneca for southeast
while development costs for dasotraline and others that are closer to nda filing will decrease
financial results for the entire fiscal year twenty seventeen there will be changes in how goodwill is treated and how development costs will be booked in
these study designs will be presented at asco this year
we are working diligently to develop napabucasin and latuda in japan but anything outside of these we don't have very many
the transfer price from japan is determined through apa advance pricing arrangement
we now cover approximately eleven point million lives in our medical pharmacy program
this is primarily a result of additional anticipated pharmacy sales for our pbm and part d products
we will continue to work proactively with states to expand our integrated care management programs for individuals with chronic and complex conditions we are currently focused on three populations
our first quarter mlr in florida was approximately ninety percent on a reported basis
please refer to the complete discussion of risks in our most recent reports filed with the sec and in the cautionary note in today's press release
they have great expertise and what they're doing basically is selecting out of the larger group of pbm's available
we believe the unique solutions that we are developing for mcc of florida including specialized crisis intervention emergency housing and interaction with law enforcement will prove to be applicable in other states
as noted the normal seasonality of part d will result in lower reported segment profit in the first half of the year
in our florida smi specialty plan we've seen continued modest benefits from our operational and medical action plans and have recently added some new initiatives
we continue to be pleased with the level of free cash flow generation from the alternatives platform and as we have explained on prior calls we generate returns from the infrastructure platform in two ways
we still intend to return substantial capital to our shareholders this year subject to approval through the ccar process
an environment here where we can continue to gain more efficiencies so we'll try and spend more time on this on march eight when we have more time together but certainly
the same types of trends that you've seen in the past subject to ccar so that hopefully does mean increase in dividends and whatever the difference is in terms of buybacks so
is it just -- i mean this makes all the sense in the world we have three entities that are relatively subscale who we think we can drive significant benefits by creating more scale
we expect to repatriate a limited amount of cash from our non-us entities due to the capital and liquidity requirements of those entities
as i mentioned the net impact of us tax legislation on our renewable energy investments was offset in the tax line
we do hope that post two thousand eighteen we would be able to start seeing some kind of benefits whether it's on the revenue side or the expense side because of the amount of money that we're investing
and so one of the things which is high in our list to talk through in detail on march eight is exactly how we think we're differentiated versus the other people that you often think of as our competitors
some of the charges in our significant items this quarter are a result of that work but we expect there will be more in two thousand and eighteen we are at the tail end of our review and we'll provide an update at our march eight investor day
and third the core underlying franchise performance excluding these two items
all your questions on march eight and we'll do the best job we can but for now we'd love to answer whatever questions you have especially about this quarter
so when we get to two thousand and nineteen we certainly wouldn't expect to see anything like this we would expect to see just
again the -- two thousand and eighteen the way it was laid out our ability to spend this additional amount of money in technology and if you work through the math the effect on -- the effect of tax
there are two i think it becomes -- it's very different in terms of what we're willing to accept in terms of payback
this includes the two significant actions we took since we last spoke
the year-over-year increase also reflects the favorable impact of a weaker us dollar principally against the british pound
the way we're thinking about spending you and i both know that you don't make these commitments on what is today january eighteen and
i was -- i'm excluding the significant charges that we had in two thousand and seventeen and whatever we could have in two thousand and eighteen when i say that and that excludes the reinvestment or just the additional charges
about taking -- keeping the good pieces of ccar and continuing to focus on how it can be made into a better tool
we want to keep them busy we want to absorb those overheads as best as we can and what we've seen during quarter two is that we've been gradually
even with the decrease in domestic wholesale we saw growth in our kids division as well as women's active and sandals and men's sport and men's and women's on the go and work
to prepare for the accelerated growth in europe we completed the expansion of our european distribution center to one million square feet in the second quarter
we plan to open approximately thirty to thirty five more stores this year including a store in the new one world trade center
as in the first quarter international wholesale achieved the highest percentage and dollar increase of our three distribution channels
additionally more than a dozen skechers performance brand ambassadors will be participating in the rio games and the entire belgian team is wearing skechers in the country's colors off the field
after transitioning several distributors in central eastern europe and one in panama to subsidiaries we began shipments in the second half of two thousand fifteen into these two regions that cover many countries
including ten key markets we believe that as we continue to open stores and build our wholesale base
and we have a growing network of franchise skechers stores in countries where we handle the distribution of our product
we believe there is a tremendous opportunity to continue to grow the skechers brand around the world as we build our presence through marketing retail expansion and gaining shelf space within our wholesale accounts
i think you got two of them mixed i think our inventories are pretty much in line now the growth is where you'd expect them to be new distributors that turned into subsidiaries
through their mobile platform within one hour of ordering the limited launch of the product has -- of this product has exceeded our expectations and we are already looking forward to expanding the program from beyond edmonton into new markets
this was primarily due to our increase in operating margin this quarter along with benefiting from a gain on translation of our us dollar denominated debt offsetting an increase in our amortization expense compared to the same quarter last year
decide but you can be a force within your category for example our milk tea has a volume of three billion that's really substantial
taken all this into consideration i don't think what happened two years ago will not occur again the objective conditions just isn't there anymore
close your eyes and imagine there are three pieces of beef in this bowl when the beef isn't there it simply isn't there it's difficult to conduct such large campaigns for our noodle products
to adapt to these industry trends i will add two more core businesses
a majority of the market so there is a lot of waste in the process now with our it system with our sales management system
as of june thirty in the first half of twenty sixteen we had no major capex the amount of fixed asset went down compared to last year we only recognized amortization
there are many cities in china with a population of four million to five million and for national players it's a long way to go it requires time
and you see numbers in the range of fifteen percent to twenty percent then you need to monitor for something big to happen
but with a return to growth in two thousand eighteen our third quarter results were also negatively impacted
will subside by the end of the year as inventories are adjusted and growth will return in two thousand eighteen our third quarter bookings support this outlook
we remain actively engaged with customers on additional twinshape duct programs that we expect to be decided over the next six to twelve months
performances or achievements including statements related to the company's twenty seventeen outlook to be materially different from any future results
management believes the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors in understanding and assessing the company's ongoing core operation and prospects for the future
the effective tax rate in the third quarter of twenty seventeen was lower than the federal statutory rate of thirty four percent primarily due to the impact of foreign tax rates and permanent differences between book and tax income
we refer to this upgrade initiative as project concrete and we spent the first part of this year conducting a detailed rfp functional due diligence and ultimately a selection process for our future platform
as we did in our first quarter ten-q we'll include a comparison in the footnote to show our revenues reported under both the new and the old standard
and adjusted ebitda grew by twelve point nine percent these results were driven by the strength of both new and existing shacks as well as by our focus and ongoing commitment to invest across our key digital initiatives and foundational infrastructure
reiterating the way we run this company from day one we're thinking about everything from a very long term we're adding systems that will support
outlook as you look to the back half of 'eighteen maybe if you can frame it as to how much pricing you would think you'd need to hold the margin flat or do you even think you have pricing power here to take if you wanted to offset some of the labor
the maintenance price increase for those customers who don't take advantage of the m two s program and less discounting and promotional activity
but erp systems continued to fill the void in terms of the whole financial planning and budgeting aspects and some of the financial aspects
so we're going to make disciplined choices between inorganic and organic execution over the next five years in
is that it leaves behind a three d model that is a huge asset to the owner in terms of managing maintaining and using their asset as time progresses
and we are enhancing our construction offering with the acquisition of plangrid first let's look at arr which is the best proxy for measuring progress in our business model transition and the overall health of our business
customers are deploying all modules of the bim three six oh platform and i am excited to share that large customers like aecom arcadis swinnerton and layton have already started adopting our new platform and we look forward to more customers doing the same
which historically have been very heavy during q four even though our full year expenses are moving up modestly our operating margin for the year will be higher by one percentage point versus our previous target
that's the way we see this unfolding in the future we're not going to go into the erp space of construction we're going to stay on the whole life cycle from design all the way through to site execution
the strength in arr was a result of accelerating growth in all geographic regions and across all product families
highlighting strong execution as well as adoption and expansion of eba contracts
also our new margin forecast for the year represents nearly seventeen points of improvement over last year
lower channel discount on autocad lp and an increase for multiuser subscriptions
how important is it going to be that autodesk has both the underlying bim data as well as the plangrid capabilities versus others in the space that maybe don't have that underlying bim data
are going to be a more important driver but in the long term as you head out three to five years
i think there are going to be more opportunities there were in twenty fifteen with more stress in the insurance system than there has been historically and we expect that to continue into two thousand and sixteen as we expect to continue to attract talent
where prices improved following a number of high-profile breaches that occurred at the back end of twenty fourteen and into twenty fifteen and that drove increased demand and stronger pricing
which is often seen as a bellwether for the rating conditions for the rest of the year prices continue to drop in our portfolio by five percent now with overall pricing reduction
last area that i want to highlight is the sme part of our portfolio we've been growing the number of customers that we have in this segment in both property and specialty lines and marine over the last several years
we open an office and are great at recruiting people and fill them up and look for move for larger space relatively quickly and we've done that and doing that with la
the second element was we bought more protection in two areas of the account firstly within the large lawyers and architects and engineers within specialty lines
also on claims as martin mentioned the reserves have continued to develop favorably in twenty fifteen and our consistent approach to setting those reserves means that we finish the
against that background and that expectation we do however continue to plan for moderate growth in twenty sixteen our planning process every year is around cycle management that's pushing forward
we still don't really understand that how do you approach it and are you going to continue to focus on bbr or will you expand out your cyber coverage
also supply of capital into the insurance industry continues to grow at a faster rate than demand for insurance products so those two drivers mean that we should
in the areas where we see more opportunity pulling back in areas that are under pressure in twenty sixteen we will continue to reduce our commitment to markets such as energy insurance
we have -- we expect to see the continued benefit of our more focused distribution strategy which has been a strong driver for growth in twenty fifteen as well as the initiative to put more of our products in more of the offices across the nation
final comment from me before i hand over to questions you may have seen in the press release after seven and a half years in this job i am going to take a couple of months off in march and april
increased regulation around privacy in twenty sixteen it does take a couple of years for
we haven't seen the development yet of demand for breach response services type products in a large way that's the piece of the market where we have particular IP as regulations
prior to the end of fiscal twenty nineteen moving on to capital allocation
this compares to national brands that were down sixty basis points over the same period
while the grocery channel has stabilized and showed modest growth in two thousand and eighteen by comparison the dollar and drug channels have experienced a decline over the same period
and i'm wondering what does this mean as we go forward is this the q four kind of the right mix to think
reconciliation from gaap to adjusted results is provided in the press release and supplemental slides posted on our website
and once that happened from a cash flow standpoint we had enough to support the remaining assets within the cpd division
while we are in the early stages the team is making great progress in improving cpd margins
the lack of a major outage in twenty eighteen and achieving higher selling prices in both businesses in the second half of the year
and established japan's first LCC propelled by the expansion of the international business we have continued to accelerate the speed of our growth
to build on these results and pursue continued sustainable growth we outlined our management direction for fiscal twenty twenty and beyond through a new corporate strategy
the first point is to expand our airline revenue platform both ana and the lccs will improve basic quality then we will pursue an optimal portfolio and expand our revenue platform
we also will expand revenues for the cargo and mail business shown in green and the lcc business shown in orange
please see page six next i'll explain some themes related to our new corporate strategy
please turn to page fifteen this slide shows our financial platform
please see page nineteen lastly i will discuss esg and provide a summary of this strategy we believe that it is the responsibility of global companies to create both social value and economic value
in the lcc business which is recorded under other revenues vanilla air and peach aviation also contributed to revenue increases
please turn to page forty this is the status of our international passenger operations
the third point is the utilization of open innovation and ict by improving our product competitiveness and promoting work style reform we'll contribute to the realization of the ultrasmart society
we will use this performance as a platform for accelerating our pace of growth to an average of four point nine percent annually over the next five years
we will continue with aggressive capital expenditures as shown in table one to the right ebitda is projected to exceed the capital expenditure during this strategy period
please see page eighteen now i'll explain management resource allocation as we advance our business and improve free cash flow our policy will be to shift stages in our business management cycle
earnings for each quarter of this fiscal year represent record highs for operating income and ebitda please turn to page thirty one this slide shows an overview of our consolidated income statements
on china routes capturing greater inbound demand among individual travelers pushed the third quarter load factor up by ten points compared to the previous year
at present we plan to begin this operation in fiscal twenty twenty and expect this to contribute to our group's growth strategy
now i will go over the details of our air transportation business please turn to page thirty six this is a year-on-year comparison of changes in operating income for our air transportation business
gilles has taken you through the main aspects of the market development and the business performance on the following slides i would like to focus on the financial performance of the two divisions and the group
our operational and geographical spread continued to provide good natural hedges and our ebitda margin remains well protected against these currency fluctuations
in the mature markets we grew with a solid four percent led by japan spain and italy a strong contribution came also from northern europe and germany
clarify what the benefit is is that savings that will drop straight through to ebitda or is that in sales
which is not really agreeing with that type of number so would you be able maybe carl to call out the three -- the couple of end markets here that were the
although somewhat lower than q one we are now leveraging that healthier demand environment with a lower cost structure
we've experienced two consecutive strong quarters and we are still cautiously optimistic that orders will continue to be strong during the balance of the year we're watching this market closely
was distribution up i'd say probably the one that i'm a little bit more cautious on -- two of them would be
we are fortunate that our large oem customers in the ag market are performing well
i would not expect more than the ninety basis points in the second half if you look back
we've seen one or two projects where the customer didn't take delivery at the end of the quarter and so that gets moved into
and the risk described in today's news announcement and in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission including the company's reports on form ten-k and form ten-q
but i would say that we'll be back to a normal situation by end of march which is going to mean that from beginning of march to really april the evaluations that should have probably kicked off three to six months ago are really be kicking off and in full swing
while we are fully transitioned to a significantly more capable erp system affording us added oversight and efficiency over the operational and financial elements of the company
we ended the second quarter with fifty five global sales team members compared with forty one at the end of the second quarter of last year
what we've done is we've gone from five regions to seven regions so if we look at -- four of our sales managers have joined us literally over the last six months so there's been some changes there in terms of the way that we structure the management of the territories
in terms of the eight-k announcement and some of the leadership change we had a structure which was maybe a little top heavy in that we had a senior vp of sales
as a final note you may have seen from the recent form four filings seabed veil investment has reported selling a portion of its shares
a couple of the slides that were in the materials from last night in there you see two groups of wells one group is our increased completion design so in that group of wells we actually had more pounds per foot and more pounds per cluster
the amount of maintenance capital that we need in order to hold rate flat so we think we've done a good job in the first part of this year building our rate back up to say that forty six thousand to forty seven thousand barrel a day range
because we're talking about maintenance on a higher production base compared to what was discussed on the q four call or there was something else
all of our leases that are not actually completely filled in where we have the most opportunity to drill fifteen thousand foot laterals for the most part that acreage is actually out in space
and that's where we see the future growth and the future potential of the company so with that early introduction i'll turn it over to kyle for a summary of our q two financial results
i mentioned earlier we have two different zones that we like geologically and we have two different completion techniques and so one of the reason we added two more wells was that we think if we are correct in our thesis about the completion technique
our oil rate is growing our ebitda is growing loe is continuing to work lower
we would hope that within the next twelve to eighteen months or so we will come to a conclusion and
we'll invest approximately don't hold me to it but approximately one to three years after founding when the initial proof of concept has been demonstrated
with a strategic value that medical innovation offers to our core businesses in the six areas where we do have most of our cases
we fulfilled our two thousand and fifteen financial outlook for all categories reaching the upper end of the guided range
implies a case-mix index improvement of more than one percent and as you do recall from previous calls that meets the clear main top line goal to develop
please turn to page three of the materials next i will talk about our management approach over the next three years to achieve our overarching objectives
our assets are competitive because of impairments we recorded in the year ended march two thousand sixteen of course we have to deeply reflect on the reasons for these impairments which unfortunately led to an overall loss for the company
i will begin by providing a simple explanation of three external factors that we are facing
if we look back at the more than sixty years since mitsubishi corporation was founded
please turn to page five of the materials as i mentioned in the beginning
please turn to page six of the materials we aim at shifting from pursuing growth through investment in businesses to deeply engaging with businesses
in order to achieve further growth at the same time we will accelerate portfolio re-profiling based on business life cycles this will be a task for a little longer than three years
please turn to page eight of the materials as i explained before while continuing to invest and maintaining our overall investment balance in the resource field
our operating results for the first quarter of two thousand and sixteen represented the best first quarter in our company's history
with the average annualized increase in shareholders' equity plus cash dividends over the last five-year period
we have also some other costs that have been gone into not only opening those three we do have three more openings one is only for this fiscal year we will be opening this month
and we have a resource that appropriately -- and that is part of the costs we're seeing but we are excited about the possibility of having a new area or two to get some new bank customers
and so we -- when we look at international expansion we're not looking at europe or asia or anything like that but we are looking around the borders of cxi and
in twenty sixteen for the year our international sales increased in each of our groups
when you look at twenty eighteen you're looking at the absence of conexpo you're looking at the absence of this accounting issue
if we're fortunate enough to get a pellet plant order and we're fortunate enough to deliver some of it in 'eighteen it will not be dilutive okay
first half of twenty sixteen foreign exchange translation had a positive impact on sales for the first half
the way we intend you get that into your pricing over time some of these deals are under contract for a period of one year or two years and you've got to wait sometimes to get the escalation in price but we do have annual price increases that in the end should cover
in the following quarter or two we expect the same thing to happen as we progress through the fourth quarter and into next fiscal year
or two but we kind of felt the pain with the hiring and the startups into the third quarter
but i think what we saw in q three was just a more drastic trend than we had seen in the previous quarters but this has been going on for about a year and i expect at some point -- i don't have a clear indication on when that's going to end
we are pleased with the progress we've made over the past five quarters since i became ceo but recognize we still have much hard work ahead of us
we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures
when the program is complete we expect to have approximately three hundred employees and we also anticipate that we'll have transferred more of our engineering responsibilities from the philippines to poland
somewhat unique because we played the role of an si in that deal and that was obviously a multimillion dollar deal
we are experiencing delays in some of our cost-reduction efforts in certain geographies as a result we now believe it may take through the end of the year of fiscal two thousand and eighteen to complete the remaining activities
during q one we realized revenues from our previously announced win of a mobile carrier in the middle east
but i would say that they're in the range of the high six digit to low seven digit price range
if not will most of the cost to come out be in the cogs line
i'm very pleased to report that we continued our strong performance in two thousand eighteen with another record quarter for the company
our updated forecast is based on strong maci growth trends as reflected by orders to date in the second quarter of the year -- or second half of the year
given the rapidly expanding physician customer base and positive experience with maci as evidenced by accelerating volume growth
of what our new reps have been able to do in the previous two years and we have every confidence that these
their efforts are reflected in the strong sales performance to date and by the fact that over eight hundred surgeons have trained on the maci procedure since launch
does the fact that this tam is now so much larger change that strategy or are you still planning to or intend to
we commissioned a qualitative and quantitative primary market research study with over two hundred surgeons
but that is mainly due to the manufacturing expense in the first half of two thousand seventeen being a high comparator while we were manufacturing both carticel and maci as well as the initial maci manufacturing learning curve
is that it's built our confidence along with evidence from this new tam
these statements may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and that are fully -- that are described more fully in our filings with the sec which are also available on our website
as nick mentioned our commercial team has successfully executed this expansion process the last two years and we fully expect the twenty nineteen expansion to be just as successful
as demonstrated by the recent expansion of the cigna maci medical policy to include patella defects
and converted a total of eleven restaurants to the grand saladier program
the combination of our retail products and expertise and mty's broader reach will position us for future success in this area
the structure of the deal also allows our shareholders to benefit in the combined synergies that the two entities create as well as participate in the future growth
increased cost for the rejuvenation program in the quarter it was meaningfully higher than we've seen in other quarters so maybe some more color on what those costs are related to and if that step up is something we should expect in twenty eighteen as well i
the transaction multiple looks like it's more in the seven to eight times ebitda range which to us doesn't seem like it's
please note that today's call is being broadcast live over the internet and will be archived for replay both by telephone and via the internet beginning approximately one hour following completion of the call
both mty and imvescor's board of directors have been unanimously supportive of this transaction
and while we have never reported out on our guest counts we are proud to report that in q four our guest count traffic was positive two point five percent and for the fiscal year
of the new mty it offers our franchisees the opportunity to increase their leverage with goods and services which will then enable them to be more profitable
okay great and in the past you've been able to quantify the approximate percentage of your operating ebitda that comes from these retail royalties is that a number you can break out for us now
all that attractive when you look at some of the other transactions that have taken place over the last twelve to twenty four months so
this is especially impressive since mikes renovated seven restaurants during the quarter
also under marie-line pizza delight returned to have another positive q four with same restaurant sales
the offer from mty represents an opportunity for shareholders to accelerate that growth
we also believe that by combining with mty imvescor shareholders will realize immediate value and have increased exposure to growth with less risk
this is all growth and opportunities that won't be lost to shareholders under the mty combination
these savings have concretely manifested themselves this year in the form of being able to optimize seventy one branches and reduce the corresponding headcount
on the labor front we continue to see average unemployment to be around ten percent and we expect it to continue to be around those levels and it would only improve and go down to single digits after the economy grows close to the three percent area
as far as the final adoption of this decree after an eighteen-month period of adjustment which starts now
with respect to our consolidated performance during the quarter these are the main highlights first we were able to maintain our nim both due to a solid performance of our nim and investments and our ability to cut cost of deposits
now that the standardized model is applied our banks will see a relief that offsets the impact of the net deductions to cet one including the full deduction of previously grandfather goodwill
there are two ways that you can get results from a digital strategy on the one hand you should generate more revenues
which basically levels the field in the sense that porvenir will now be able to invest up to eight percent of its total administered funds
as we look forward to the opportunity fiscal twenty nineteen presents we will continue to execute the formula that delivered the improvements we realized over the past year
we experienced in the first quarter of fiscal two thousand and eighteen store expenses as a percentage of sales decreased approximately sixty basis points
leading to a twenty basis point improvement in our operating margin during the fourth quarter
we currently have signed leases for five additional new stores to open in fiscal twenty nineteen and beyond we continue to monitor new store performance and remain comfortable with our targeted store openings
marking over fifteen consecutive years of positive daily average comparable store sales growth
now i would like to briefly highlight some of our other accomplishments during fiscal twenty eighteen during fiscal twenty eighteen we significantly expanded our natural grocers brand offerings
thank you david and good afternoon everyone it is my pleasure to review with you the results of another solid quarter and a strong finish to fiscal two thousand and eighteen we have worked very hard over the past twelve to eighteen months
we opened one new store and relocated one store during the fourth quarter of fiscal two thousand and eighteen compared to opening no new stores and one relocation in the fourth quarter
in q three we continued to show strong growth across the nordic region both organic and acquired
an update to our codexis pipeline snapshot with data current as of june thirty twenty seventeen note there is a modified more informative format to this year's pipeline chart
but rather simply accelerated and hence we expect this year's extra spending will translate into commensurate savings in twenty eighteen with improved confidence from the preclinical trials
it's terrific to see the acceleration of product revenues unfold in twenty seventeen our new guidance range for product sales
already just at the halfway point of twenty seventeen we have nearly matched all of the product gross profit dollars
and earlier human data results we are increasingly encouraged by the potential opportunities presented by our pku program
hyper-convergent technologies and the changes that are going to occur in the it world
they're more like fifty five-forty five and i think that's probably a decent balance for us we want to make sure that our portfolio companies
so some of the things we're looking to do is develop other programs outside of the four that we currently are in to make utilization of those opportunities number two
fully funded season it for a quarter or two and then you're selling the conventional fees out for the gain on sale
with respect to five oh four loans the junior debt is taken out
we're not just trying to put numbers on the books because in the lending market the problems always show up two three four years down the road so i think that
there is positive carry while the loans are held in the warehouse and there is significant fee income that we receive on five oh four lending a lot of that is
through an expected larger investable capital base across the solar platform suns will be more of a full solution provider which should result in greater deal flow for solar senior and our first lien loan program
and involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual results may differ materially as a result of a number of factors including those described from time to time in our filings with the sec
companies in their target market the team has developed a strong pipeline of investment opportunities which they are currently evaluating for q three and q four of this year
and later the recorded video will be posted on docomo's website -- IR website
so if the arpu goes up then you may introduce some new billing plans and return those profits to the customers isn't that the case
but are we going to go through the same thing three years from now i think that's not what we're talking about
during the fourth quarter of two thousand and eighteen the company reviewed its collection experience for technical and professional cases and determined that the original estimate of revenue was higher than the company's actual cash collection experience
going forward we will adjust these numbers initially at the six-month point of the year they may go up they may go down at that point in time based upon how we're collecting money
this was at the end of december of two thousand and seventeen there was an exhaustive amount of work done because we were concerned about the amounts that were being accrued and booked as revenue we found at that point in time
the growth of the company and legal and professional fees and costs related to various issues in two thousand and eighteen earnings from
and unprecedented levels of documentation being provided by sellers we will start seeing more accounts qualify for the legal channel than we have in the past eighteen to twenty four months
much of the success we have seen is the result of our long-term view from five years ago which gave us the ability to expand our capabilities
when you grow your domestic collector workforce as much as we have in eighteen months it's expected for average tenure to decrease
us insolvency continues to have good flow available and we're hopeful we can keep up the pace of volume
and we wanted to give pra a potential opportunity to benefit from any reduction in rates so
resulting from the irs settlement and is reflective of permanent cash tax savings as well
we built new call centers and new capabilities we expanded existing centers and existing capabilities all ahead of the opportunity we have seen and continue to see especially in us
with a lower cost and we've talked earlier about the supply chain we have the biggest supply chain in the nordics for any it
and i want to say thank you to all the seven thousand -- actually seven thousand one hundred employees who have been on the journey with me and a lot of my colleagues
as you can see from this chart atea's operating cash flow is highly seasonal peaking in q four and with negative cash flow in the first half of the year as working capital balances increase from a very low level at year-end
comment on the legal process and the case that we have going and have been working with for almost three years in denmark the court case has finally started it started on the tenth of october
it is not the destination to build a modern it infrastructure and solution
services revenue grew by eleven percent from last year with higher sales of both consulting and contracted services
what happened during the first day was that the name ban was lifted on the seven individuals
terminal four will be -- moving on to your second question terminal four will be fully fast travel enabled for passengers to do self check-in and self bag drop which will be helpful for us because that helps us to be more productive
the first kitchen that we are building is in -- just outside of shanghai and that kitchen is in the process of being constructed now as i mentioned at the full year results six months ago
to better respond to your questions with myself today are executives from sk innovation and its major subsidiaries
for twenty seventeen annual dividend in light of record high operating profit following the previous year
and second question is that there has been a significant decline in terms of the bunker c and naphtha margin what is the driver behind that
what is significant is that the approval was granted just three months after its submission
first our history shows we have been an innovator in this industry for decades our ip estate is valuable since it provides us with technology that is royalty-free
it is also estimated that over seventy percent of women will develop the candida infection during their reproductive lifetimes
if you look at the investor presentation that we've had out there the last two investor presentations one page we do have out there is where we compare dime's yield on loan portfolio to maybe twelve other peers in our marketplace
please remember to refer to the forward-looking statements disclosure on page seven of the company's earnings press release
okay and as we kind of work towards that three-year time horizon in terms of
sj will review business highlights and provide color on the operating environment silvia will then review the company's key financial results
by the end of march our integrated mobile product offering continues to generate new opportunities for us in the marketplace in this quarter mobile revenue was up approximately forty percent over the prior year
with respect to our payment processing pipeline we have many opportunities in front of us and as mentioned we won two new nonfinancial institution opportunities in the quarter
earlier this morning we released the results for our first quarter of the fiscal two thousand and seventeen year and i hope you had a chance to review them
we probably have two or three other ones that we think will be involved in rfps sometime between
and i'm pleased to report this quarter that we won two new nonfinancial institution pieces of business in the quarter these wins represent some early success for us in this area
this is the third anniversary since we introduced the dividend program and the board declared a twenty five percent increase in the quarterly dividend over our prior dividend
one will be approximately fifteen hundred seats and the other one will be a smaller seat count but will have a much larger transaction volume
and our safety results demonstrate this commitment and i'm very pleased with the progress that the company has made in the last three years
we have already completed four of these steps and we continue to work on changing the culture of air products by focusing on safety simplicity speed and self-confidence
now please turn to slide thirteen for a review of our gases americas results
we expect the new three hundred million standard cubic foot a day expansion of our existing relationship to commence later this year
yes we are looking at sometimes kind of making a wholesale deal with people in terms of acquiring many plants rather than just one or two plants
please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and in today's earnings release
we would expect these tsas to wind down in twenty eighteen and are committed to taking actions to reduce the resulting stranded costs
now please turn to slide fourteen for our europe middle east and africa business volume strengthened and profits were up on constant -- on a constant currency basis
just for your information in may we plan to file an eight-k with the sec
and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the ceo of the company something that i take very seriously
now please turn to slide ten you know that air products continues to be very focused on cash flow
now turning to slide eleven you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share
net cost performance was unchanged as our productivity actions and the tsa income were roughly offset by higher maintenance costs inflation
we do expect to see additional outages impacting costs during q three it was good to see the one percent price impact on sales
we remain committed and confident in our ability to deliver on our cost savings and our eps commitments
with a midpoint which is a substantial increase of nine percent over the previous year
sounded like china had worked out some of the early problems with their coal to meg processes and we're going forward with a number of projects
that plant had been operating for over thirteen hundred days right and we were able to push and push with regulatory people the right to continue to operate that plant longer as we've gotten smarter and better in how we operate and
the lng business continues to be down towards the bottom and so we don't see a lot of change in either one of those
accounted for six percentage points of the increase modestly higher selling prices contributed the remainder of the increase
with growth accelerating throughout twenty seventeen in our generics and contract manufacturing market units we expect a stronger second half of twenty seventeen compared to the first half
and therefore we had that anticipated in really first half of 'seventeen but that was brought forward a little bit earlier than we anticipated
commercial production in dublin has already begun and will ramp up throughout two thousand and seventeen and we remain on schedule with the first phase of our waterford ireland site
turning to slide eight this is a snapshot of our innovation and technology pipeline
roughly sixty percent of that cash is invested overseas and is generally not available for repatriation without tax consequences
we've already received fifteen hundred containers that will be financed with debt we're also investing in technology projects including transportation management system
we remain quite focused on continuing to grow this business unit and expect that two thousand sixteen will continue to offer both challenges and opportunities
these increases were partially offset by a four percent decline in loads from durable goods customers
all right so you're saying that fifty percent of the rail rate increase you were able to cover with your own pricing initiatives
to the extent you could kind of force rank where you're saying the greatest pressure from and maybe kind of characterizing it in three buckets one
can you review the timing of the rail rate increases did you start paying higher rates on january one or is all of the rate increase
the impact of expected share repurchases we anticipate rail service will continue to improve and that utilization this year will be one day better than last year
but then secondly as you on-board the customer it takes time to ramp it up to get to the margin levels you need generally it's ninety days ninety days after start-up you should start to see the margin levels that you expected
and another portion will go in june one so part of the rail pressure might have already been in the first quarter or that -- is that the wrong way to look at it
the main reason for the increase is the full quarter revenues on the four container vessels on charter to evergreen which were delivered to us end of may
cautionary language is also included on slide one of our earnings release presentation which we will use to go through our discussion today that presentation is available on our website and i encourage you to open it if you haven't already
yet even with active production in the unit for over five years production appears to be in line with expectations and is still cleaning up we've also seen production uplift in some of the existing parent wells
that pad is just down-dip of where we map the pressure transition and would be a useful data point in extending the successful application of slickwater completions in area two that
on the next slide slide four like to highlight once again some details of our recent well results i already mentioned the kudu pad is coming online pretty much as expected and in line with the type curve
which is currently scheduled as our second slickwater appraisal test in area two we could also make this a two-well pad instead of a single well as it's currently scheduled
that was a success on the axis three and then so we repeated that on all of the kudu wells
on seven of those eight pads we've seen production uplift in those parent wells
three of the five parent wells in the unit are currently flowing without artificial lift where they had been previously on rod pump or gas lift for several years
pad was originally scheduled as another single well test and we're currently evaluating accelerating the timing of that pad as well as whether or not we'll make it a two-well pad
additionally we also have a large inventory of other area two locations from which to choose if we were to change the drilling schedule to add in more in area two drilling
prior to getting started i'd like to remind you of the language in our forward-looking statement section of the press release which was released yesterday as well as in our form ten-q which will be filed today
it's important to note that we are not saying this is the twenty four-hour ip for this well as peak production has not yet been established
our working interest tends to be higher in area two so that would be a change to our capital program and anticipated production
we don't expect a material change in our anticipated full year production as a result of the schedule change we are still projecting ten thousand to eleven thousand boe per day of production
we also have the option of accelerating the development program by adding a third grade concentrating on area two development and that also depends on commodity prices but we do have the liquidity and flexibility to bring on that rig
this was mostly related to a noncash change in the fair market values of the derivatives portfolio which was driven by a decline in the wti oil pricing during the quarter
provide additional analytic tools to understand our operations tables that reconcile non-gaap financial measures to gaap results are also included in our earnings release issued today
while our confidence in our growth opportunities remains unchanged revenue estimates for twenty sixteen have been adjusted primarily due to two factors
is the third consecutive quarter of adjusted ebitda growth since the third quarter of twenty fifteen which was the first quarter during which we initiated the on-ramping of significant new amounts of traffic
as we sit right now it wouldn't be impacted by these nonrecurring costs we would have more than sixty billion minutes of use on our network
as for arpm it has continued to exhibit stability and even grew modestly this quarter
which negatively impacted adjusted ebitda some of these are related to the significant ramping of traffic that we've experienced and some are not related to that
while our adjusted ebitda margin expectations are largely unchanged the absolute level of adjusted ebitda is expected to be modestly impacted primarily by a lower level of revenue than previously expected
during the third and fourth quarter that do enhance other parts of our cost structure but a relatively low arpm minutes
but the takeaway is that these will be largely transitional in nature that while they will impact twenty sixteen results we don't expect them to impact twenty seventeen and forward in a similar fashion
consistent with what we articulated over the last few quarters we remain confident in our belief that adjusted ebitda should increase with each successive quarter throughout the year which results in an upward slope throughout the year
the takeaway from a financial perspective is that we believe we can consistently deliver increasing adjusted ebitda results
so that we'll have it in twenty seventeen but we wouldn't necessarily have had it for as many months of twenty sixteen as we would have initially hoped for
market prices for resin were up more than five percent during the quarter compared to last year
has been impacted by increasing overcapacity of rtl as multiple regional players have built excess production capabilities for internal chinese demand
our diversified revenue base in ams continued to provide strong organic growth filtration and transportation were the key drivers
adjusted operating profit and ebitda to all increase slightly higher than adjusted eps due to higher projected interest rate expense from our bond financing
more specifically in ams we expect continued sales momentum and improved margins as a result of pricing actions potentially moderating resin costs and benefits from the austin closure
while we want to be clear regarding our gaap results and the items they reflect when adjusting for these onetime items
and the capex pattern for 'seventeen is going to be also a mild one
in terms of roic so we need and we want to exploit it we need to get them to their
but still in 'seventeen we are going to have some noise that we'll have to explain to you and has to do with costs being dragged up by revenues so the net will be the right one positive
financial information calculated in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures
of nineteen ninety five our statements may be affected by certain factors including risks and uncertainties which are discussed in detail in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission
operating cash flows were up more than forty percent for the year and free cash flow was up more than seventy percent color had another great performance in the fourth quarter and the group had an outstanding year
and this is the third consecutive quarter in which the group's operating profit margin increased at least one hundred basis points over the previous year's result
the company's return on invested capital has increased steadily over the last five years
with that concept in the flavors group and i think a lot of the execution of that we're going to continue to see improvements on that in twenty seventeen that is going to be key
strategic and restructuring and otherwise we looked at the portfolio we looked at what we had and we looked at what we wanted to be and we estimated at that time that probably about ten percent of the portfolio
when i think about just where the fda rules have been for like color additives it can be interpreted by some as being very vague very loose
during our call today we will reference certain non-gaap financial measures which we believe provide investors with additional information
that will be more heavily weighted to the first half because most of that fx change took place in the second half of last year
these non-gaap financial measures remove the impact of restructuring costs currency movements and other costs as noted in the company's filings
which normalized in twenty sixteen adjusted operating income come excluding these corporate costs increased by seven percent in local currency for the year
that is -- that was the outcome there and so a lot of that conversion had already taken place such that probably about eighty percent of that market has converted
picking good acquisitions twenty years ago spending a lot of time on new product development developing those businesses investing in the sales and technical forces and i think that's culminating in us having a very strong position
in addition during today's call unless otherwise stated references to our results are provided as non-gaap financial measures and are reconciled to our gaap results
i'd like to share two of our notable customer stories with you to underscore the business outcomes customers are experiencing on the platform
services revenue came in slightly lighter than we were expecting as some services projects pushed out due to q four holidays
i would also like to share some assumptions that we have built into our guidance i'm pleased to confirm that we will continue to be on track to reach breakeven profitability eight to ten quarters from the time we went public
and the embedded operating system that we deliver as part of pcf is preconfigured to those standards
we're pleased with the early traction in pks deals during the first year of availability and continue to be encouraged by the growing pipeline
our focus is on delivering the right level of services to grow subscriptions and to make customers successful on our platform as we continue to build virtual capacity with our si partners
which would be during the first half of our fiscal 'twenty one with regards to revenue we expect mix to continue shifting towards subscription
that's where kind of the virtual capacity really builds outside of pivotal but just to be clear from a subscription sales cycle the si partners are really helping accelerate consumption of the software and expansion
we expect services revenue for the year to be relatively flat to last year as we enable existing customers to be self-sufficient leverage our si partners and as maintenance revenue associated with legacy products continues to decline
actual results may differ materially as a result of various risk factors that have been described in our periodic filings with the sec
compared to fifty six percent a year ago and continues to be the primary driver behind our top line growth shift in revenue mix and margin improvement
application in production on the platform very quickly then they tend to expand rapidly and as that expansion takes place we can hand off to our si partners
another thing that they bring there is their open source -- curated open source distribution which actually forms the underpinning for pks now as well so those are combined
we are pleased with our performance for the first half of two thousand seventeen and we are optimistic about our prospects for delivering continued growth and returns to our shareholders for the remainder of the year
the fact that we were able to close so many deals in q two i think is a credit to the platform but probably more a function of coincidence and timing some of those could have just as easily
to the extent that libor continues to increase we anticipate benefiting from higher interest rates in future quarters
but we would only use the atm if we thought it made sense and our historical pattern has been to be very cautious on it we announced that we might do it we've gotten several inquiries from people asking us
so you did see some of that but it doesn't flow through the overall numbers because of the increasing libor rate
for those viewing our presentation please turn to slide seven in the second quarter we further diversified our portfolio
to provide larger and more comprehensive capital solutions to our borrowers than tcpc could pursue on its own
and even a twenty five basis point increase in rates would be accretive third our low cost of capital and diverse funding sources are key competitive advantages for tcpc we remain well positioned with attractively priced leverage
primarily in fourteen investments most of which were senior secured loans
we are running the business the way we have always run the business taking advantage of our two decades in the business and our strong sourcing model
equity market or equity issuance via atm or other means once you've achieved that target leverage
as a result of the increase in libor if you look at our
please see the release and our sec filings for information on the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially
just a couple of final thoughts on numbers while quarterly results are important i consciously look at our last twelve months results as a signal of the company's strength and it helps guide my thoughts in the direction we are heading
as a reminder we are a small public company with a footprint that covers thirteen countries which means that we have costs that are largely fixed in this area the increase is primarily due to increases in employee-related costs
both of these updates to new products support the first two cornerstones of our strategic plan continuously investing in our engineering efforts as well as broadening our product line
our focus over the past six quarters has been on cost control and we have begun to transition that focus to the future of this great company
and then turning to renovation activity i know you highlighted in the disclosure about ramping up activity in q two and q three can you give us a sense of the kind of numbers you're talking about and any particular brand focus there mid-year
operating ebitda margin on system sales typically lower in the first quarter due to system sales at the lumpy and the lowest level following the busy christmas holidays
we also expanded our online aggregator relationships which includes ubereats to over a hundred restaurants to enable customers to place delivery and pickup orders through the channel and application of their choice
now let's move to our performance for the five operating segments starting with zone americas
the increase was also helped by lower commodity cost as well as by strong rig that also led to better industrial capacity utilization and better operating leverage
areas aoa's underlying trading operating profit margin remained strong and highly accretive to the group the decrease of twenty basis points was due to the phasing of certain cost items
as CEO i have the full authority to undertake this analysis and implement the right actions to meet our objectives
our underlying trading operating profit margin increased by twenty basis points in spite of commodity and packaging cost headwinds of another twenty basis points
in the later part of q two and finally we finish with the other businesses
plus three percent on the other hand sales of chocolates with high cacao content weakened slightly after a very strong performance in the previous fiscal year
as the graph shows our business growth has outpaced that of the overall market since two thousand fourteen thanks to customer support for our products and especially for choco monaka jumbo
since last year we have increased tv advertising and we'll continue to step up our efforts to bolster the strength of our in brands
it therefore seems our hi-chew has become one of america's more commonly consumed candies or perhaps the candy selected by those looking for a somewhat more sophisticated treat
including improvements of intangible assets we look forward to building the strong foundation for the future over the three years starting from the current fiscal year
a twenty percent expansion in our product capacity for the core product since last year and our ability to maintain steady production
consumer evaluations of hi-chew have risen steadily and its fans show no signs of tiring of its delicious taste
awareness of our products is gradually rebounding and recognition of hi-chew and other products made in japan is being increased through the e-commerce channel
this time around however we have succeeded to get hi-chew into some test markets and in-store turnover thus far is comparable to that in america
such as hi-chew chocoball and ramune to get our products into a wider variety of sales outlets and channels we are providing our brands our most valuable assets
elsewhere in asia as previously noted sales of hi-chew in indonesia were weak as we have not been able to gain wider product recognition
before turning the call over to our cfo david grande who will update you on our financial position i would like to first address some of the significant developments in our efforts to return value to our stakeholders
we have had success with the sale of a puerto rico go claim the sale of a portfolio of private equity holdings we had in our investment portfolio
with this recent approval we will record another loss on debt prepayment in the second quarter of two thousand and nineteen when this payment is made
our financial highlights deck and sgi's audited statutory basis financial statements
we will continue to look for opportunities to derisk sgi's insured portfolio through commutations reinsurance and other hedging strategies
on sgi's long-term surplus notes in july and december of last year which have not yet been fully accretive to par
in particular we believe the drive toward local content by many national oil companies will prompt more local startups thereby expanding the market for equipment that nov provides
it develops designs and manufactures flexible pipe and water treatment systems for subsea production applications and enjoys considerable technical leadership and advantages having delivered over seven thousand processed miles of flexible pipe
finally before i hand it over to jose to take you through our financial results i'd like to take a minute to thank our employees for your excellent performance in two thousand and seventeen there is no better team in the industry
while we made progress in q four our working capital levels have remained frustratingly high through this downturn
market dynamics and our introduction of new delta premium connections set this business up for a stronger second half of twenty eighteen and
the issue resulted in a shortfall in revenue and excess costs in the fourth quarter and will also impact q one however we are confident we have a solution that will get us back on track later this month
therefore for the first quarter we anticipate modest improvements in most businesses offset by challenges that will persist through mid-q one in our subsea business unit
over the next few quarters we anticipate seeing more feed studies to evaluate the economics and feasibility of new projects as major operators appear to be more seriously evaluating new offshore developments
our use of the term ebitda throughout this morning's call corresponds with the term adjusted ebitda as defined in our earnings release
after a seventeen percent sequential improvement from the second to the third quarter a less favorable mix and lower volumes of drill pipe contributed to the decline in the fourth quarter
is through these investments that we were able to secure this project and it is through this project that we will have our best opportunity to date to demonstrate how nov can provide better fpso solutions
for a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business please refer to our latest ten-k and ten-q filed with the securities and exchange commission
notwithstanding the falloff in q four revenue bookings were better than anticipated and we continue to see significant improvements in drill pipe supply and demand fundamentals
our comments also include non-gaap measures reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gaap measures are in our earnings release available on our website
after three extraordinarily difficult years it feels to us that the market is nearing an inflection point oil inventories are rapidly approaching normal levels pushing oil prices up and facilitating the return in our view of a geopolitical risk premium
we expect free cash flow in q one will decline due in part to the first meaningful incentive compensation payments we will have made in three years
rapid adoption of our ert power sections which provide up to twice the power of conventional motors is contributing to the strong performance as is pricing for our drilling motors which has nearly returned to twenty fourteen levels
in this environment we expect to realize two hundred to four hundred basis points of sequential top line growth with strong incrementals we expect stronger top line growth will accelerate later in the year assuming oil prices hold at current levels or better
for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal twenty eighteen our results and related discussion do not reflect these changes and are therefore on the same basis of presentation as our previous quarters
as you might infer from our guidance we expect some drag next year from lower workers' compensation and sui rates
in 'nineteen we just don't believe that it could be as large as it was in 'nineteen and don't at least have that planned currently
it made a massive turnaround and now we have -- i think it's close to sixty percent of our new business bookings coming from
could you help us understand your expectation of relative contribution from these initiatives in fiscal 'nineteen and
similar to last quarter our peo bookings and retention were strong in the downmarket while we have continued to see some pressure from larger client losses in the mid-market
remain excited about the future of the peo now i'd like to focus on the strong progress of our investments to improve the client experience
and financial outlook for the next three years we received a lot of positive feedback and for those of you who may have missed it
such as global cash card and workmarket our leading position in the global hcm market continues to represent a significant opportunity for us
we also continue to engage with a number of key partners including our recent partnership with microsoft to bring together workforce now and microsoft dynamics three sixty five business central
which impacts our revenue but is ultimately a positive development for our clients and for our peo prospects
we feel actually better and i realize that the guidance and the discussions we had were about 'nineteen through 'twenty one but when you finish 'eighteen ahead of where you thought you were going to finish we would like to get a little bit of credit for that because what we're trying to get to is
and they have really worked hard to drive and control our overall it infrastructure cost so we have seen help from that in this fiscal year and i think we'll anticipate that going forward
so it's kind of hard to give you a completely bullish answer because we're trying to be very very disciplined but we've been very very fortunate in the last eighteen months and i hope that our luck continues and that we find things that can really
when we reflect on all these accomplishments which are many in twenty eighteen i just want to thank all of our associates for their dedication
i would also like to note that as we outlined during our recent investor day beginning with the first quarter of fiscal twenty nineteen we'll be making some changes to our disclosures and reporting
of the renewed momentum within our sales force following fiscal twenty seventeen we were also pleased to see our new logo strategy continue to show results with double-digit new client growth this quarter and nearly double-digit growth for the full year
may at times introduce a little bit of noise to the peo margins now that it is included in our segment results
many of the rules haven't changed around aca it has been -- some of it has been defanged and you're getting i think the outcome that you would expect if you are taking away
kind of what's happening in the revenue growth numbers and in the noise but in the peo the most important thing for us in the peo is profit per employee
outer years so what that means is we finished 'eighteen a little bit ahead of our own expectation so we have really terrific momentum going on
you also have an economy that is incredibly strong and has picked up momentum from a gdp standpoint
of certain items in the fourth quarter and full year fiscal twenty eighteen as well as the fourth quarter and full year fiscal twenty seventeen a description of these items and a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures
now let me spend a few moments on the recent performance of our peo revenues for the year grew twelve percent in line with our expectations
and with that i'll turn over the call to jan for his commentary on the fourth quarter results and fiscal twenty nineteen outlook
among the changes we made to our segments is the inclusion of adp indemnity into the peo segment earnings
positive development in the last several years and so this is not the first year in 'eighteen where we've had a benefit from what we would call release of reserves if you will now some of that is related to
and we feel 'nineteen is exactly in -- is in line and contributing to our overall goals so we're not really changing our expectations for the
not just for 'nineteen but i think it's the way we think about the business which is to have kind of
and we continue to see incredible momentum with financial services cloud in q one we had a significant expansion with a fortune fifty financial services firm that is clearly betting their digital transformation on us and is now one of our largest customers
just a couple of weeks ago i was with the ceo of one of the largest insurance companies in the world and we're having a conversation about changing their business model and transformation
a description of these risks uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our sec filings
every single one of our cloud benefits from einstein in this way and by making it easy to adopt and easy to use our customers are actually seeing the value of ai without hiring a legion of data scientists and that's really the promise of einstein and really our philosophy behind
which obviously had a great quarter in q one but one of your competitors in the space is now adding commerce functionality by way of an acquisition
with the company almost from its very start where we were very early investors in the company and carried it all the way through to ipo and
intelligence we saw that recently with an ai demonstration from our industry
this balance is broken down into the amounts we expect to recognize as revenue in the next twelve months or current
they are working to understand and have a three hundred and sixty-degree view of their customer and the power of that is really
building ai for crm is our ability to make it easy for our customers to use and adopt and benefit from this revolution we're seeing in ai so what you're saying is just by turning on einstein our commerce cloud customers for example have seen some
and three is the system of intelligence bret touched on it with einstein with ai but even look at our advanced analytics capabilities that we now
i think that the idea that you need to build a one-on-one relationship with your customer something that we've been saying now for almost twenty years is probably more true than ever
augmented by our suite of CRM applications that do that for them things like our
but b two b commerce as well and i don't think anybody can really touch the tremendous success we've had since
for the first six months i think that in many aspects of our industry we've been going through a crisis of trust
similarly it's difficult to articulate the disappointment that we didn't extend that further into the second half after a series of seismic events in south africa ended that run in the last six months of the year
looking at the full year we saw our investments across the portfolio helped to deliver production growth at four percent cash flows were also strong despite the higher capital
this agreement was concluded on the sixteenth of november last year it is anticipated that about three thousand employees
the project capital extends over a six-year period this is intentional to optimize the cash flow
the strong performance in the second half delivered production of just over two million ounces up fifteen percent over the first half
stronger cost management and stringent capital discipline has resulted in the all-in sustaining cost margin increasing from seventeen percent in the second half of last year
the second is the stability agreement the stability agreement effectively gives the fiscal and legal stability which is required for certainly the initial ten-year period and there is an option for both parties to extend it by another five years
regarding phase one of the below one hundred and twenty project the completion of the decline system below the current secondary shaft is on track for completion
the two big challenges that we have recognized and will be very focused on is that this is a complex project to execute because it involves demolition refurbishment and building new
passing two million shifts without a fatality tautona marked more than a year without a fatality which i'm happy to say is a feat that a number of our operations now can also claim
in terms of our expenditures to pull that down the biggest jump in the capital expenditure in 'seventeen came from the specific brownfields investments we did and that is behind us right now
could not be taken into consideration in two thousand and seventeen this deferred tax benefit will only be recognized on the completion of the transaction as part of the overall profit
the facility carries an advance rate of up to eighty five percent on eligible contracts which means that the facility is available to fund the majority of the increase in the company's portfolio growth
and with the credit group that we now have we've been able to continue to split those fico bands by attributes
timing perspective the bid date due back to us is nineteenth of november and then it's just a question of sorting through the things you need to sort through when you receive the bids
and so we won't pursue anything that doesn't meet our internal roa targets so
in the past we had marketed to a range of customers using fico as a proxy
and was appointed cfo for the group in february this year
as i previously mentioned we continue to expect other revenue and other income to decrease fifteen basis points from the loss of lease income for the fourth quarter in two thousand and sixteen for the full year we now expect
a replay of the call will be available till december six we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in transcripts of this call by third parties
we continue to believe that we have significant opportunity to grow this category from a penetration level of eleven percent to north of twenty percent which is in line with our peer set
we have now experienced traffic increases in eight out of the last nine quarters
we continue to expect other revenue and other income to decline by approximately fifteen basis points
as i mentioned we continue to drive positive traffic and with the third quarter we have now recorded positive traffic in eight of the last nine quarters
ted is a highly accomplished business leader whose thirty years of retail experience is a strong complement to the expertise that is currently represented on our board
as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter in two thousand and sixteen due to this transition from a leased to an owned business
gives us confidence that we can reach thousand stores over the long term
good news we had in last year's q four and as you think about -- that was the worker's comp i just mentioned the incentive compensation that was good news last year
we finished the year with three consecutive months of improvements in each of our three internal customer satisfaction scores
but having said that it was a relatively small test so these were three markets
led by our field leaders our teams are more aligned than ever on the priorities for two thousand seventeen and
there's risk levels of everything we need to do to get to that kind of a twenty percent run rate some of the things like avocados have already come down so that's going to happen you're already going to see
reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures can be found in the company's third quarter earnings release which is posted on the company's website
so these past six to eight weeks is really the first opportunity they've had in a long time to focus on nothing but the business
a participant or sort of dictating the process because you as a reit you want to make sure that you have a use of proceeds at least to some degree line up over and above the seller financing idea
there should be a fair amount of mom -- whether it's a mom-and-pops or whoever it is who are currently in a lot of trouble that may not make it to 'nineteen do you think that's a fair statement
would you consider moving that to ridea structure should we expect maybe for you to do more ridea or some other kind of operating joint
we expect all but one of these sales will occur over the remainder of two thousand and eighteen the expected delay of one being due to a potentially longer hud approval process
from nic only because this was a really unusual year in terms of the flu season historically
we have seen and felt was worth the risk of turning into a ridea structure and
and thereby remove kind of that issue for investors such that we think we can have better execution and further differentiate ourselves from being a snf reit so our position right now is that we're going to be opportunistic
in addition references will be made during this call to non-gaap financial results
turning the page to slide five strategy for the business is to remain the leader in graphic papers
i found it appropriate to open with a few comments describing how i had spent my first one hundred days in the role
this forecast reflects the latest view for sequentially lower steel costs next quarter and a full quarter impact of tariffs on chinese imports at the ten percent level
at the same time we've made hay products more widely available throughout our design within reach retail studios
these projects are progressing on schedule and we expect to begin realizing benefits from improved efficiency and lower costs as we move through the back half of fiscal year two thousand and nineteen and into the first half of next year
the midpoint of this range implies an organic revenue increase of seven percent compared to the same quarter last fiscal year
a little above what the street was anticipating for both revenue and eps if you could maybe just touch on that a little bit where it gives you confidence
majority of the revenue guide is largely due to the volume is it safe to assume that you have good clarity on the asp as well for the rest of the year
but that doesn't mean that results are a generation away or even five years away based on our current trajectory and the evolution of the landscape we are driving we see this network effect contributing to the growth of our business now and expect that impact to accelerate in the coming years
it goes without saying driving up this collection rate continues to be a primary focus and we are beginning to see signs of success nine months after bringing our billing in-house
we view increases in our gross profit as a critical indicator that we are on the right track by driving up collections and driving down cogs to generate an ever-increasing gross profit to cover the opex and other costs of running our business
there are four million births a year and over three hundred million people who could otherwise benefit from proactive genetic information services
it's a huge opportunity we suggest in all seriousness an addressable market of more than one billion people in modern medical systems worldwide
in this effort i believe the fundamentals speak for themselves out of nowhere relative to typical time frames in this industry we are poised to become the leading provider of inherited genetic testing services in the next twelve to eighteen months
thus we will provide billable tests not only in our ten-q filings but also in our earnings calls moving forward
as we have said before we will not experience significant reduction in cogs and operating expenses from the integrations until they are in full swing by midyear with our volume and cogs on their current trajectories and positive signs to the upside for reimbursement
could have their holdings redeemed for class a shares which are listed and traded on the nyse as
this dividend was paid on december thirty one to shareholders of record on december fifteen with that i would like to open up the call for questions
going forward in twenty sixteen what we may be doing with the observatory and as part of our annual budgeting and planning and
i can still remember in late nineteen ninety eight asking johnny what his real expectations were for the new bank
we survived the craziness of the year two thousand with the regulators and we are still trying to survive the craziness of the regulators today i should get an amen on that one right
thank you all our loyal supporters who have been with us for many years and to hell with the naysayers this has been a wonderful twenty years and many have been with us since we started
we concentrated one year on an efficiency project that changed the way we operate resulting in a model of management and a leap in profitability and we have stuck to those principles today
we became a publicly traded company in july of two thousand six we thrived during the recession we raised capital in two days and bought failed banks over a period of several years it changed our corporation forever
impressive still under forty percent i mean are there any major expense initiatives that you have to undertake or regulators making you invest anywhere that you wouldn't have otherwise or anything that will drive that incrementally higher from here
and that is the last twenty years of record growth and profitability we have now completed twenty years as a banking organization since we opened up here in conway arkansas
this feature causes the clo trust to delever more slowly so that the timing of capital returns to ladder is more closely matched to the timing of loan payoffs
and so the ones that adjust every five years you really don't need inflation to do better because what you do is you buy a year-one cap rate and then you ultimately do better over time
with the weakened us dollar a ballooning deficit and recent economic stimulus added to an already growing economy we feel that interest rates will continue to rise but at a modest pace
those rates have not really come down much at all in the last eight years probably the only spread product that hasn't come down to my knowledge and what happened was when the unsecured corporate bond market opened up
so we are confident enough that the refinance activity will be so robust in the years ahead because of all the capital raised in the space that's causing that spread compression in the clo market
can you help me and tell me where you think the ten year is going to be in that period of time
every day the stock market goes up three hundred points a certain money moves into the bond market and comes off the table and i do sense that there's a fair amount of demand right now for spread product
so i don't really expect to see a cost-of-funds increase over the next two years because i think any rapid prepayment will result in
this is our highest reported earnings quarter since the beginning of two thousand and fourteen we benefited from our rapidly growing inventory of balance sheet loans
we have doubts about the fed raising rates four times this year that pace would hurt the housing market and we don't think the fed wants to do that
additionally certain non-gaap financial measures will be discussed on this conference call the company's presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation
non-gaap items are described and reconciled to gaap results in today's press release and those and other reconciliations and supplemental detail are included at the end of the slide presentation which again is available on our website
i would assume that increases in revenue would increase our ebitda margin cash flow should also continue to be
we expect further challenges to negatively impact our performance in the fourth quarter and as a result we've updated our full year revenue and eps targets accordingly
this strong aerospace performance was partially offset by a six percent full year sales decline in distribution
and i'd like to walk you through some of those to better understand two thousand sixteen and
and other customers for additional orders that would provide visibility into twenty twenty in the year ahead we're very focused on execution to drive sustainable long-term growth and improvement in our operating results
i'd like to focus the balance of my remarks on our outlook for two thousand seventeen and capital deployment priorities
with all of our projected direct commercial sales occurring in q three and q four also impacting our cadence is a pushout of missile fuze deliveries from the first quarter into the second quarter
in addition we expect to discuss certain financial measures and information that are non-gaap financial measures
turning to the full year many of the key trends that persisted in the fourth quarter also shaped our two thousand sixteen results
this reflects negative sales growth of slightly less than one percent at the low end and positive sales growth of four percent at the high end and is reflective of the challenging end markets we continue to experience
our expectation is that we will recognize less than ten percent of our full year net earnings in the first quarter and approximately fifty percent of our net earnings in the fourth quarter
we expanded operating margins by fifty basis points for the year in a declining sales environment a very solid result
retaining focus on efficiency and extensive work in scaling up the business lines we've built over the last three to four years
we plan to further expand the product range building new value-added services and adding lending products throughout sme marketplace
as kind of comparable to your thinking in terms of your twenty nineteen guidance
so you get basically a beneficial impact on the fourth quarter cost of risk but that's kind of -- that would have been spread out through the whole of twenty seventeen but you took it all in the fourth quarter
that is not affected by the change in standards we continue polishing the ifrs nine accounting model for our loan portfolios i can share though that
our new monthly credit score monitoring product was a great example of this not only can someone open an account through web or ios app in only three minutes
slide twelve we thought it would also be helpful to give an illustration of our business model as you can see from this slide
but with over twenty five million canadians with a credit score and very few of them tracking it there's a clear opportunity in front of us
we're about to have four different products customers can come in directly to any one of these products obviously for those customers that come in just for their credit score there's no revenue directly associated with it
turning to slide fourteen let me first start with a summary of our financial highlights from the quarter
which tripled from the additions we had in q two perhaps more impressive was that this was accomplished on lower absolute marketing spend during the quarter which means that we substantially reduced our cost of member acquisition
so turning to slide three canadians have primarily relied on their banks and credit unions to help them manage their financial lives yet while the banks enjoy record profits many canadians struggle financially
we have many enhancements to our loan experience and our road map over the next twelve months which will continue to improve the convenience to our users and dramatically improve the efficiency of our platform
of q one this product will be kind of fully rolled out to -- available to all of our members
which is now live in more than twenty five countries with more than seven million downloads so
the consequential amendments to ias one we adjusted the presentation of other operating income and other operating expenses in order to allow for a more granular view of the company's operating expenses
both retro running stars from the nineties that we refreshed and brought back with significant commercial attraction the tresc run and the lxcon are also great examples for new silhouettes
secondly our focus on key cities our six key cities in the world continue to set a pace and influence for the rest of the world on how fashion and sports trends are being created and also being rolled out
and we saw strong profitability improvements while continuing to invest in compensating fx headwinds so we continue to see fx headwinds in a year where we had the highest profitability ever in the history of company
that is what is expiring we'll continue to do business with dick's sporting goods in our normal way of doing business for the adidas brand and of course also for the reebok brand but i do want to clarify this what has expired or is expiring
one of the things i'm most proud of is the way napco has been able to remain at the forefront of innovation in the industry
at napco we take their feedback and market insight seriously the good news is that based on our conversations
in addition napco continue to gain traction on the heels of the successful launch of our comprehensive line of starlink commercial fire and intrusion alarm communicators
the increase in sales for the three and six months was due primarily to increased sales of the company's door locking products and intrusion products
well we don't want to take it all at once we only want to use what we need for the given quarter in this particular time frame we got two different guys to agree to spread it out just the way we want it
which flow through to the rest of the income statement we believe that these inventory controls were the right decision effectively trading higher cogs for improved cash flows
we have all contributed you have all contributed and hopefully many of you will continue to make your mark going forward agi needs you all to pull with us to create what is truly possible
and tim how long do you anticipate the reorientation of the sales team will take until you have it where you would like it focusing on those two different distribution channels
i remain a believer in the long-term market opportunities that tim and his team will pursue agi is ready for the next stage of development under the next generation of leadership
we never could have built agi without you so i hope that you know that i know and that i'm very appreciative
we believe that korsuva has the potential to address pruritus across a range of medical conditions
at week twelve with respect to the weekly mean of the daily worst itching intensity score
we are encouraged by the progress that we are making so far but we're also aware that improving operations and returns at phi will take time
as you know we filed distribution cases in all of phi's jurisdictions and expect decisions spread throughout the third quarter of next year providing needed revenue relief as we continue to make significant investments on behalf of our customers
at phi we are encouraged by the process we're making although some of this success has been helped by good weather
these increases reflect recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments meant to improve the reliability of the grid across all the phi jurisdictions
and we're pursuing the compensation for the zero-carbon attributes of our plants as we've done in new york
in new york we're making progress on finalizing the contracts with nyserda and expect to have them signed for all three plants in november
the lawsuit does not request a stay or an expedited trial and we continue to believe that the ces design is sound and that it will withstand any legal challenge
turning to slide fifteen even though we don't believe this market will be a reality we are acting as if it will
we are moving forward with the retirement of the plants we have already notified pjm of our intent to retire quad cities and will inform miso in the beginning of december if the legislation does not pass
recall that we were running both the submissions to the fda in parallel and because of the volume of information we decided to prioritize
in terms of working all your way through the screening process and here we are on november eight or nine i think you get a sense of when that might have happened
we are also integrating fda feedback into our approach and timing
the type one trial and obviously reach congruence with the agency and initiated the study and dosed the first patient so as a result of that we're working through the
for those patients to be in the trial meaning we should be able to enroll it relatively quickly so in the scheme of things a couple of weeks really won't be material other than the two very important reasons i gave at the onset of my answer
and we believe indicative of a strong demand from parents with type one incidence to participate in this study
and sit without assistance for at least five seconds two patients in the cohort could crawl pull to a stand stand and walk independently
the collective and broad impact we have seen in children treated with avxs-a one on many aspects of the disease enabling them to develop in the best possible manner is truly remarkable
so we're actually very encouraged by the launch of spinraza because it's demonstrating that clearly there is a market out there in need it's demonstrating that payers are willing to pay for
sure sure and the follow-up is actually a clarification it took roughly about three point five weeks to get the first patient enrolled did you say how many patients have been screened in the context of patient enrollment and what's your understanding of the
it is remarkable for all patients to reach this key time point of twenty months
in europe we've initiated additional formal clinical and quality scientific advice proceedings with the ema and initiated the process to discuss the potential for a conditional registration pathway for the eu we have
what is your sense of what the willingness of parents will be to enroll type two patients into your study given that there is now an improved product on the market to treat them
post the initial phase i study that have been exposed to both one oh one and nusinersen and if there's any data that you could collect there that could inform
did go on spinraza now given that this was after completion of our trial i do not have any insights into any other safety or efficacy data that may have been observed
as compared to thirty two point one percent in the prior year period primarily due to the favorable impact of the new federal corporate statutory income tax rate
in the first half of two thousand and nineteen we remain on track to file our prior approval supplement for vancocin oral solution
while we are proud of these results they do trail our original expectations for the first half of the year driven by the aforementioned declines in inderal la average selling price
let me start off by thanking all of us auto parts' team members for remaining focused on the customer experience and their continued execution of our strategy and operating plan
the third quarter was underscored by our continued commitment to profitability as reflected by the fourteen percent increase in adjusted ebitda despite having only modest revenue growth
we would still expect our turnarounds before the aosp acquisition to continue generating free cash flow and debt repayments exiting the year in that
good morning everyone and thank you for joining our conference call where we will discuss our operational and financial results for the first quarter of two thousand seventeen and provide an update regarding our ongoing projects and operations
maybe towards the end of this year and into 'eighteen we don't expect that will have a major impact on differentials and the reason we believe that is that there is significant real capacity
the most positive part of the past few weeks was holding our investor days in toronto and new york where we issued our new five-year capital plan
although we await next steps from ferc on the miso roe complaints the new methodology appears to be generally constructive and we will look -- we look forward to getting closure on these outstanding complaints
the decision ended solar net metering in tep's service territory
therefore itc is currently reviewing the order and considering its options including rehearing and appeal
residential and small commercial customers who install solar will now receive a monthly bill credit for excess energy exported to tep's distribution system
the complainants to respond to that filing and then ferc has to really take that material and then make a final order on those complaints
i wanted to provide an update on a decision that itc received from ferc on roe matters just after our new york investor day
this recent order provides guidance on ferc's new methodology for establishing roes which is expected to be used in addressing outstanding complaints
the funding strategy also supports improving our credit metrics over the five year plans
presented us with a potential loss of supply thankfully enbridge was able to get it parallel thirty inch transmission line back in service quickly
you will notice that us tax reform did not have a net impact on earnings per common share during the quarter
we exclude from our non-gaap results a number of charges or benefits that are either noncash or that we consider outside our core ongoing operating results
in our new vcsel laser fab in sherman texas we have completed the uplift of the building and installed a significant amount of the capital equipment for our first phase of capacity
but in terms of adding additional capex that's something we're evaluating now but it's certainly not something that can have an impact on q two just to be clear you did haven't -- ordered another slug that will be coming in
i need to remind you that any forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which are discussed at length in our sec filings
we have begun the internal qualification for a process of all the equipment and still expect to be qualified and in production using our six-inch wafers by the end of this calendar year
can you give us some sense of what the rate of growth was in the roadm business quarter-to-quarter it looks to me as i play with the numbers that it was very steep and i'm looking at the guide and i'm thinking
to get it onstream so we should expect fairly flattish for six months and maybe addition maybe not depending on what you decide to do is that the right way to think about it
with the issuance of further guidance by the irs in the third quarter we had to adjust our provisional estimates related to repatriation of foreign earnings and reevaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities
that's fair yes typically the way it works with the large oem is that you will notify your intent to trigger price increases as per their contracts and then that goes into a negotiation of the
anything sort of unusual in the three q mix
i also want to remind everyone that any forward-looking statements made during this call are subject to risks and uncertainties the most important of which are described in our press release and sec filings
china truck sales have declined on average and we anticipate calendar year to run about twenty five percent of last year peak level
over in twenty nineteen collectively at all of the above noted projects we can count many many billions of dollars of recent current and planned capital investments for which we will fully benefit while never receiving a cash call
after much anticipation we could not be more excited to finally open stk orlando at the end of may
the restaurant will be located in downtown miami on biscayne boulevard at the new me hotel through a management deal with our partners the me hotel group
these successful openings give us great confidence in the brand as we enter many new and exciting markets executing against our two thousand and sixteen development plans
we will continue to look at the additional leases but only in the major us and worldwide cities and use license and management deals to continue to expand beyond the five countries that we are currently operating in
we have a combination of eight company-owned managed or licensed restaurants and unique food and beverage hospitality deals
additionally we will refer to some non-gaap financial measures on this call and certain measures presented on a constant currency basis
was a coauthor of a paper that won the best theoretical paper award for twenty eighteen from the international journal of industrial organizations
with the transaction scheduled to close no later than the first quarter of twenty eighteen in the preliminary proxy related to the transaction
performance on the platform remains consistently strong with fund appreciation of four percent in the quarter
these three transactions are just a few examples of the types of investments that carlyle pursues which quite frankly few firms have the expertise or resources to complete
we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures during today's call these measures should not be considered in isolation from
we expect to turn on fees for our latest vintage us buyout fund towards the end of the second quarter and the new asia fund in the second half of the year
scaling our funds will not only drive fre growth it also improves our ability to invest in both target investment capabilities and critical growth areas like global credit
and we are tracking towards a meaningfully higher level of fre by year-end
that more than sixty percent of our capital commitments come from investors that are in six or more of our funds i think second of all we continue to see new investors come to the platform
second i want to remind everyone that we expect a lower level of net realized performance revenues in two thousand eighteen compared to twenty seventeen as we transition from the older vintage of funds to the newer vintage
last quarter we highlighted our expectation that on average the next generation of funds will be approximately thirty percent larger than the previous generation
we've only touched this -- the surface of it and we do have very large ambitions to grow so if i can now break that down a little bit clearly we're already large in the clo business and we have no intention
the global lp community ranging from sovereign wealth funds to retirement systems to high net worth investors
more than one hundred carlyle professionals across united states europe and asia worked together for over a year on this transaction which is expected to close in the second half of the year
in-house regulatory and tax expertise aided our ability to pull this transaction together in just two weeks on a propriety basis and it created structure with significant downside protection for our capital
average closing the gap rapidly with the industry average as we speak and this is an area of strength from bournemouth water they have consistently been top or very nearly top of the sim leagues for some time so we're looking forward to bringing best practice across the two companies
but we would note that there is probably a h one or we expect there to be a h one weighting in the financial performance
and then we will establish the maintenance regimes to give us reliable twenty five-year income
this five-year cycle and i've got to say that i'm really looking forward to bringing bournemouth water and south west water together because we have a little bit of a mantra it's my mantra to say
and i should also point out as an aside that the customer service center the contact center which we'll need for the retail operations that has been separated for over ten years in our case
you can see the key metrics in terms of where the actual results have landed for the first six months
and we're very pleased to note that we managed to get unconditional approval to that merger and now we're fully engaged in bringing the two companies together i'll also say a few words about the future because there is
people actually believe that they will work and they realize there's an opportunity there with heat i spent the early part of this week with two chief executives in different parts of the country looking at the potential for heat offtakes in two of our facilities
to be cautious i would say that for two thousand and seventeen i don't think anybody expects any of these segments to
but some of the recent contracts are spreading over next two years delivery and are they coming with a similar type of discounts that scales us
as a reminder we have no cre construction loans in houston and only ninety two in total cre land and construction in the entire portfolio
was a specific reserve for the problem credit we've been talking about now for almost eighteen months that got resolved it was supposed to get resolved
any more color on this and i think you mentioned a few minutes ago that there could be some higher syndication fees in four q i'm curious if this is energy related
june thirty it didn't quite close through the bankruptcy court on june thirty it closed the very first business day of july
we also made progress towards extending our global footprint in our latin america and asia-pacific regions in latin america we signed a training and cooperation agreement with the brazil ministry of health and seven science and technology institutions
so they fit completely with what we've been trying to rebuild over the last five years in terms of a continuous stream of exploration drilling potential going out over the next few years
this will be eleven wells in the next sixteen months so we're going to be busy we'll be testing prospects in mexico as i said including our first operated wells
so we have the right to acquire up to a thirty percent working interest upon a well decision following completion of the seismic program and full geological and geophysical interpretation
we feel we are in the position to work out at the same pace we are doing in the first two years
in my first nine months with tessco we've implemented a number of new initiatives we incorporated these initiatives into a sound operating plan and as you can see from our performance in the first quarter we are executing on that plan
we do expect the changes we have made and continue to make will result in some fluctuation in our results during the remainder of the two thousand and eighteen fiscal year
before i turn the call over to aric i wanted to give you a recap of our tessco one event which was held in early april tessco one is our annual conference
and i think our sales team is very energized right now and q one is just an example of some things that i think we can see in the future
thank you david and good morning everyone this was a solid quarter for tessco as the sales momentum that began in the second half of last year continued
as an example tessco has been selected by verizon as a supplier to provide distribution of a broad array of wireless network
and we are on track to accomplish both of these goals in fiscal two thousand and eighteen we do anticipate some fluctuation in our financial results this year as we implement a number of strategic changes across the
in addition when you think about some of the large projects that are pending as well such as five G perhaps that will be next year we'll start to see some impact of that
to grow but perhaps look a little different than it has in the past until you get to the conversation around what's five G going to being
we began fiscal two thousand and eighteen focused on growing our top line and improving profitability and we made good progress toward both of these goals this quarter
in the commercial dealers and resellers or var market revenue was up slightly from a year ago while gross profit was down slightly
forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and tessco's results may differ materially from those discussed today
as part of the program tessco will also support verizon's general contractors with similar programs
our q four growth was positive and in line with our historical trends so we expect consumer's organic growth will be back to more normal historical levels during the first quarter
incremental strategic investments lowered margins by seventy basis points in the quarter as we indicated during our december outlook meeting
we saw a number impact for total year 'sixteen right in the middle of that range and for the fourth quarter i will call it very similar to that of
within three M and that was part of what we also laid out in december
we are increasing investments in a number of core platforms to accelerate growth in twenty seventeen and beyond
yes julian that's -- and i'll just put it in perspective we've had that particular item being noticeably negative on our margin for the first three quarters of this year and getting that to be neutral for us for the fourth quarter
and that's down noticeably from where we've been in the first three quarters of this year so all in for 'seventeen we're still expecting the
we're anticipating that and taking that into account most of our raw material or commodity benefits we're seeing are going to be the result of three M efforts we're doing to take
we started that investment in the fourth quarter of two thousand and sixteen and that makes up a little over half of the total
looking forward the group intends to distribute future surplus capital via the base dividend every six months
we wouldn't be issuing franked dividends if we didn't have franking credits by the thirtieth of june so the amount of franking credits that are required
we are confident that our strategy to grow qantas loyalty earnings keeps us on track to reach our twenty twenty two ebit target
unit revenue for the group was up five point seven percent for the half as the aviation industry took action to address rising fuel prices
and favorable FX on foreign currency sales also contributed to the overall increase in revenue
is the stability of ebitda the key differences in the cash flow performance relate to the reversal of temporary working capital benefits
the new singapore first lounge is set to open towards the end of two oh one nine and
the ancillary revenue strength from the jetstar group was assisted by the successful launch of plus three kilograms carry-on increased catering and the bundling strategy
to offset inflation and any other headwinds and the pipeline of initiatives for financial year 'twenty is also progressing well
our focus on improving the value of the program continues with significant expansion in partners over ninety added in the half
the group is at its optimal capital structure and continues to generate returns on invested capital much greater than ten percent as a result
having some extra costs in connection with the acquisition of scales
natural gas revenue was impacted by a forty percent decrease in aeco during the quarter
your q three performance seems to have been quite strong especially on the margin front could you just elaborate a bit on what drove
we had also positive performances in ict revenues and particularly in wholesale this quarter
personnel costs for the first nine months of twenty eighteen were impacted by additional bonuses
we're getting ready to expand this program to date more than five thousand drivers have registered for the smart phone app in our pilot states of ohio and west virginia
exploring new sources of revenue and preparing the workforce for the future we're making good progress on all four areas of focus and i'd like to share a few highlights from the latest quarter
before we wrap up this recording i'd like to share some recent recognition erie earned from two national organizations for our commitment to employee health and wellness
erie has received either a platinum gold or silver award from the group each year since two thousand nine preparing our workforce for the future is an area of focus that very much involves our employees today
and a favorable end to twenty sixteen we continue to be pleased with the market share of our product -- of all of our product categories
regarding the use of non-gaap financial measures a reconciliation of each used non-gaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap financial measure was provided in yesterday's earnings release and is included in this morning's presentation material
unit margins in our chemical segment were up compared to the third quarter of twenty seventeen on higher prices for tofa tofa derivatives and other high-value products
while resolution of raw material access is ultimately a function of weather we are working with our supplier to arrange alternative logistics at the site and as of this time we are anticipating that production in wesseling may be curtailed by approximately three weeks
our polymer segment has been delivering solid growth in sales volume and improved profitability since the first quarter of twenty seventeen and since the first quarter of twenty seventeen we have seen improved unit margins in our chemical segment
in addition we were negatively impacted by outages at our site in ohio which negatively impacted the site for seven days
unit margins in our specialty polymers business were lower than the third quarter of twenty seventeen and this was largely reflective of differences in raw material pricing and timing which steve will speak to in just a few minutes
and in france where we were forced to take one line down for eight days and a second line down for ten days due to the quality of feedstocks we received from a supplier the impact of these outages was confined to the third quarter with no lingering effect
got it and then when you think about 'nineteen and granted i
thankfully our plant in pensacola florida was not significantly affected by the hurricane and it resumed operations on october eleven likewise our warehouse in marianna
on slide five we can start with a review of the polymer segment financial results
can compete with such a high speed going through a zoning process that we can do in germany so that is one reason why we really enjoyed being on that market
and it's so easy to take one as i said to take one developer and compare them with us but we're actually very much different we have our footprint
in quarter four but there are new units that will be handed over there will always be a movement here and some
i also think it's fair to point out that due to seasonal effect we hand over a lot of completed projects in q four and by that it's a natural pressure downwards on the sales ratio
remember the last ten years in finance has just changed dramatically the culture the career tracks between large institutions and the boutique and the interest in the boutique model
of an existential philosophy that in order to compete for the next five years we need to have this or should we -- or let's discuss what we need to have
in order to continue to minimize adjustments made to gaap for management reporting we did not adjust out this accounting change historically client reimbursements have not been significant relative to total revenues
in quarter one the reduced rate is a function of the new corporate tax rate plus the impact of deductions related to the first quarter equity vest
thank you good morning i'd like to welcome you to the avx conference call regarding the results for our second fiscal quarter that ended in september
we continue to work closely with our customers in developing new products as we support the marks to complete five g deployment
pretty much comparable with quarter one so we did not see any impact there
we feel strongly that our fundamental business models continues to strengthen and is functioning well despite our ebitda not reflecting positive results
there are many aspects of financial two thousand seventeen we believe are important to discuss i will focus the rest of my comments on these issues
we have just completed one of our best years for customer retention and have a good sense that much of the success can be attributed to new processes we -- and systems and other programs we have put in place over the past two years
there are two important examples this i'd like to mention because they took enormous effort to get done properly the first was the opening of a new consolidated customer service center in newtown pennsylvania serving certain nearby regions
from 'seventeen to 'eighteen so that had a huge impact on the core earnings for the bank
which are implemented for the customers already in q four and which we will work further to the market in
but in q four we still have the impact from the loss of the one client but in q four we had the traffic last year
the return of the equity accounts for this year for fifteen point two percent which are above the target that we had set up especially good performance in the non-life business and in the life insurance
and if you come down to the underlying combined ratio you can see that this one percent up is coming from the underlying combined ratio which had moved
looking in q one then you are back again because now they both are included in the figures from the first of january
at earliest three years from the day of the potential decision to cancel the agreement but also there we can confirm that there is no indication at all that
so three notches up and you will guess that the benefits are really huge in term of financial flexibility cost of financing for our future
the intreas team decided to buy additional protection during the year you know that in the range one sector you can buy during the year
so that is also a little bit why we have set up the structure with product area so these are eight companies that are working hard
adjusted ebit margin declined by twenty basis points versus the prior year to five percent the benefits of asia-pacific growth our pricing actions and integration initiatives helped to mitigate the impact of lower volumes in europe
we won't see significant pricing actions in the fourth quarter from what's been taken in the first three quarters of the year there will be
i'm sort of wondering if this has to do with the environment or if this has to do with certain things that you're doing to alw that
it's in line with what i would have thought the closure of six facilities and the integration of these businesses would result in
i think we recognize that as we're moving through the rest of 'eighteen and moving into 'nineteen we'd expect that we'd still have some other inflationary pressures around wages or other things that will be impacting the business but we would expect that
the prior first quarter and in the second quarter we've given some of that back and the reason we've given it back is really two reasons one we've had a different pattern of growth this year
revenues in the quarter were down one percent with organic sales flat
bit of a positive in terms of FX we're also adjusting our corporate expense forecast largely as a result of
and we own the IP and so we will continue to work with boeing and airbus and others in terms of helping them in their endeavors to participate more fully
are still the same namely electrical and we also believe there may be some select opportunities in aerospace but those are the two industries that we've been spending most of our time on
where we continue to see a v-shaped recovery in the construction machinery market in china
is almost identical in fact it's up a little bit in the first half of 'seventeen if you take out that pension contribution so really what happened is we had
we actually had a sales decline from q two to q three and then the second reason is that we did have some
that's good color just one more i know you don't want to get in too deep into 'eighteen but any comments on how we should think about where eaton is hedged or has purchases locked in and how maybe the raw material climate
in canada we expect our rig count will average two rigs during the first quarter please remember that the rig count in canada during the second quarter will be affected by typical seasonal factors
given the strong customer demand for super-spec rigs we have signed contracts to provide for the completion of two new apex rigs
finally we will further demonstrate that we are a leader in walking rig technology with the delivery of the first rig with our new proprietary apex-xc rig design
you see that in the numbers that we've discussed for the two new rigs that were going to complete and so we were certainly encouraged with the favorable economics to complete these rigs
by the agreements that we worked out with customers who needed additional spreads where we were able to get within that target range of twenty percent to thirty percent for that incremental spread
so we are able to spend some incremental cash to get these rigs to work the other is really just the demands for these two specific types of rigs we were essentially booked out on apex-xks and we had a customer
in addition to the two spreads activated since mid-december demand has been strong enough that we are preparing to activate another frac spread which will begin working early in the second quarter
while we expect some early termination revenues in two thousand seventeen the impact to average rig revenue and margin per day is not expected to be significant
the economics were favorable for these two rigs as a substantial amount of the spends related to the components for these rigs were committed to prior to the downturn
this new apex-xc is expected to be delivered in the second half of this year
given the strength of our balance sheet and the fact that our pressure pumping business was ebitda positive for two thousand and sixteen we were able to maintain our active equipment during the downturn and did not cannibalize our idle equipment
first after more than two years of scaling the business lower and cutting costs we have been able to focus on growing the company again
incremental margins are probably not as useful these days just because of all the sand everybody is pumping but if we think about what that implies here it looks like sort of a sixty percent type incremental
and the apex-xc from a technical standpoint is a very good solution for his particular needs
when we look at our overall utilization at the end of the first quarter and going into the second quarter we're going to be at about sixty percent utilization and really pleased to see that number for a change
such as free cash flow and pro forma operating expense reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures
after the transfer process is completed and the patent value is determinable which we expect to occur by the end of second quarter two thousand and seventeen at such time
as well as those detailed in our annual report on form ten-k for the year ended december thirty one twenty fifteen and from time to time in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission
as we discussed on our investor day in september we are estimating the annual revenue of these opportunities in the next five years
roger will then discuss our quarter four performance in more detail and we'll then open the call up for any questions that you may have
in the first quarter twenty eighteen while this consolidation impacted and will continue to impact our results in the near term we're extremely proud of the year overall
we have right now factored into q one effectively no change and now what we have been told is sixty to ninety days we are already
as we enter the second quarter we continue our work to roll out sap in asia and europe to go live during the early part of the next calendar year and we look to leverage the investments we have already made
we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements most of today's presentation will refer to non-gaap financial results and outlooks
in addition during today's call the company will refer to a slide presentation that it has made available to participants which can be accessed in a downloadable pdf format
for an explanation of our non-gaap financial measures please refer to slide three of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today
in addition a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation
and current market conditions which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties as set forth in the risk factor section of our most recently filed annual report form ten-k
secondly the employment numbers are getting better wages are improving housing data points are improving and all four of these positive data points
large increase was in may of two thousand and fifteen but any additional increases in twenty sixteen will depend on the rate increases
based on what we know today we expect fuel and gain on sale to be headwinds in twenty sixteen hopefully offset by improvements in our utilization especially in the second half of the year
and ebit for q four results and recognize that these results are an accumulation on many individuals' efforts and focus
first even with at times uneven earnings performance your free cash flow has remained consistently robust and your leverage has declined consistently for seven straight years
if the market won't give you proper credit at these multiples why not use your free cash flow along with another turn of leverage and buy back thirty five percent to forty percent of your market cap
what percentage of your customers are utilizing more than one of your services more than two can you quantify the cross-selling opportunity you have
to start with in twenty fifteen i'll admit that there were several areas where we felt we fell short
first dating back to the beginning of twenty fifteen we discussed that the quarterly rate comps would become more difficult as the year progressed
we expect our truckload fleet to hold relatively firm throughout twenty sixteen with the only real reduction being realized by potential shifting from the truckload units into other segments such as our dedicated
loaded miles per tractor per week was down two percent for two quarters in a row now would you expect that to continue as long as the environment is loose what makes it get better and what drives it worse
as we've previously mentioned although we do not plan on growing our consolidated truck count above the twenty fifteen fourth quarter levels
can you provide us with some additional granularity on the sequential increases in ebit for swift's other non-reportable segments
i want to set the backdrop as i prepare to talk about twenty sixteen because even if you assumed an extreme case of zero percent increase
a retailer that is adding fifteen percent store growth last year and they're going to add fifteen percent store growth next year we have another account that is
we expect that on a consolidated basis the fleet will remain relatively flat from where we are in twenty fifteen this may fluctuate a little bit on a quarterly basis as the replacement cycle occurs throughout the year but generally it will be flat
these two items are closely tied as it is difficult to improve the utilization of your fleet if your freight basket isn't full
as for gain on sale of equipment we do not anticipate selling as many tractors in two thousand and sixteen as we did in two thousand and fifteen and the used truck market is continuing to soften
we feel confident that we can continue to expand dedicated ebit by focusing on driving improvement to the operational fundamentals of the sub-performing accounts
which is what drive our business model based on conversations with our customers we believe that rates and volumes will be there in twenty sixteen third
a variety of these initiatives identified through our annual planning process which may yield benefits in twenty sixteen first of all the new equipment and the technology that we're bringing in
the storms did have an impact as the east coast was essentially shut down for three days and we are now in the process of recovering
we look forward to building upon this momentum throughout twenty sixteen as we feel there are several ongoing opportunities that will further improve this segment adjusted operating ratio in coming quarters
a better explanation of q four volumes results is that realized volumes were not as strong as anticipated moving into the month of december
what are you seeing economically is the consumer starting to roll over as intermodal volumes suggested throughout the fourth quarter of 'fifteen or is it holding firm
can you provide more specifics around planned capex in twenty sixteen specifically how many trucks and trailers you intend to purchase and what is the planned net fleet growth
as shown on the next slide our lease book is well diversified both in terms of industry and also geography and the residual value as a proportion of total lease book is less than one percent we'll now go through the financial
we believe this is a unique and highly compelling value proposition to our large existing and new sme customers in australia and new zealand
we have made progress over the last few quarters and i'm pleased to see that continue into the first quarter of two thousand and sixteen executing these initiatives
of the forty to forty five company restaurants we expect all but a handful of locations to open before the fourth quarter of this year
while we are very pleased with the performance of our initial two locations in toronto particularly with guest acceptance satisfaction scores and team engagement which are some of the highest in the system
some softness during q two i think some of our other folks in the industry have also been pointing to a little bit of softness as well
as instead of the first quarter with maybe the notable exception of one brand that's been heavily discounted yes the only other thing i would add to that was when you look at the comparisons in two-year growth
it's so hard to tell because fast casual black box has a very large presence there but at the same time they don't have one or two of the largest names so i think
we will follow that introduction later this month with the launch of two new salad offerings
late-season snowstorms in our colorado market a more volatile industry environment and our most challenging comparisons of the year due to the timing of our lto this year relative to last
and then my last question you mentioned the first foray into TV i'm wondering
and we will continue to invest in this area during the course of twenty sixteen which dave will outline later on
this comparable restaurant sales figure includes a fifty basis point negative impact from the shift of the easter holiday normalizing for the holiday shift traffic declined seventy basis points during the first quarter
and we will be looking at ways to leverage that as well for some of the oe customers who are in that area and also the specific capabilities they have which are quite interesting and quite
line i'd like to point you towards is the fifth row return on sales this is also excluding the cost of uplift
and so obviously the planning phase of all of that is key to a successful delivery we have been working for a little while but as we go into phase two we will now start to ramp up
that's settling down very well but there is -- there's certainly another six months to a year of work to be done there i would say to get back to
just a couple of highlights then from the first half on a number of those points you see on slide fourteen our malvern panalytical business there on the top left
asia has been very strong was up already last year as you see up again this year and really the two engines for us in asia are china and japan
before we begin i'd like to refer you to the first two slides of our presentation
a much more aggressive price increase that will become effective may one unlike some others in our space we're
confirming the strengthening demand our lead times for plate products have expanded from approximately ten weeks earlier in the year to approximately twenty weeks
across the board and something that we're looking to address with the price increases that we're implementing effective may one as well
meanwhile primary aluminum prices have been trending steadily higher over the past two years
moving to slide twelve overall our outlook for two thousand and eighteen is unchanged we expect improving demand for aerospace applications throughout the rest of the year as destocking begins to moderate
as well it was a combination of the two that -- it was a combination of two bad rules rule factors there in the first quarter
that shows the metal price going back to two thousand and sixteen and you can see it's been steadily increasing
so all of our contracts are predicated on passing through the full us cost of prime
perhaps even into two thousand and nineteen before we completely get our practices fine-tuned to take full benefit of the capacity and the cost efficiency that we should get from this
but will be partially offset by the completion of a major project during the third quarter of twenty fifteen which we have previously discussed
for the first half of two thousand eighteen we have increased gross and operating margins by over two hundred basis points
our customers revenue growth and the growth of just about every supplier in the wfe market
and stock repurchases to include -- excuse me to increase shareholder value each of these three aspects will hopefully help you understand why ichor is a great company and a great investment
this is a good time for me to interject a few comments about china tariffs which is the other key factor that the industry is facing in q three while there is still a great deal of uncertainty and doubt about the effects of tariffs
first our financial performance in q three is proving that there is little to fear in downturns as we now know them they are shallower shorter and much more profitable than the downturns of yesterday
as we were ramping up in q one not only did we ramp up their business but we got them on a
it is becoming clearer that as much as half of all chinese imports could face a twenty five percent tariff
i'd also like to note that we have added a schedule which summarizes gaap and non-gaap financial results discussed on this conference call as well as key balance sheet and cash flow metrics
we understand that investors will always be concerned about the semiconductor business cycle but our q three outlook demonstrate that these concerns should be mitigated
we're already in the middle of doing significant amounts of qualifications for incremental revenue and even while we see a more robust q four in front of us across the board
we began initial qualifications last quarter with first revenues now expected at the end of this year and accelerating into two thousand and nineteen so this is happening
as well as the korean subsidiaries of other oems which will be an incremental revenue driver for two thousand and nineteen we have also the opportunity to expand our market share in liquid delivery modules
as we look into two thousand and nineteen and with that i will turn it over to jeff to provide more detail about our second quarter financial performance and our guidance for the third quarter
much less send them to inventory at the oem and wait to be integrated so
during our third quarter we will experience an inflection point where net commodity cost pressures become a tailwind instead of a headwind please turn to slide four i want to briefly review our global businesses
we believe maintenance free batteries are the preferred choice of motive power customers emea continues to experience healthy motive power sales growth
these gateways are a fast and easy way to power and connect five G security or any number of other internet of things or iot devices
our cto sees tremendous opportunities to drive up performance and drive down costs
another operational focus for us right now is looking forward to the alpha transaction to make sure that we combine the two respective supply chains
customers' acceptance of nexsys pure is as strong in emea as the americas and we believe sales will make up over ten percent of their revenue in the near future
as you know on october thirtieth we announced our agreement to acquire the alpha technologies group
our adjusted effective income tax rate of nineteen percent for the second quarter
please now turn to slides eleven and twelve as usual we have provided information on a year-to-date basis similar to that for our second quarter on prior pages
see forward-looking statements included in item two management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
this transformational acquisition is an integration of two leading businesses with complementary strengths alpha's mission is to keep the world working by delivering solutions that meet today's and future power challenges
the recent drop in spot rates for lead won't improve our results until mid q three consequently our gross profit rates should improve by
we issued an eight-k and press release and held a call similar to this last tuesday announcing our acquisition of alpha technologies
we expect the vast majority of this reduced volume to be offset once we have additional tppl manufacturing capacity allowing enersys to expand sales
our best estimate is that more than five million antennas will eventually be installed to provide complete five G coverage
on a product line basis motive power was even while reserve power was down three percent now a few comments about our adjusted consolidated earnings performance
we've got two factories in china that have a capacity problem because of china tower
we have accepted and are in alignment with the recommendation of the fda accordingly
furthermore to ensure that we're prepared to quickly start the trial following IND clearance
which is also compelling so we'll need to say but as of now these are completely two different paths and each has its own
we believe an optimal dose therapy protocol of just three to four visits that offers much faster resolution of psoriatic plaques and greater convenience to patients has the potential to dramatically increase our market share
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows for calendar year twenty seventeen and we believe that we have sufficient cash resources to fund
i think we passed the final test just last week that we wanted to get through to show that we had the right product working and doing the right things and we are preparing our submission to fda to set up that meeting
as we've discussed our vision for strata is to become the dermatology and aesthetic medicine partner of choice
our sales reps are being incentivized to work with our existing customers to improve the understanding of the value of xtrac to their practices
strata salespeople currently are undergoing training so they can effectively sell the nordlys in addition we will be adding highly qualified personnel to support the marketing effort
our third strategic goal is to expand the market for xtrac principally by adding proprietary treatment protocols which require far fewer patient visits
we are already starting to see benefits such as reduced gas consumption and fewer service calls we believe that by the end of the year we will be at a run rate of thirty percent to forty percent fewer service visits
as well as expanding the awareness of our other indications that can be treated effectively with the xtrac i'm enthusiastic about positioning strata as the valued business partner of choice for dermatology and aesthetic medicine practices
but we want to do it in a controlled way and multiple sites so we're going to do fifteen patients over three sites and run our protocol with that
our goal is to position strata as a business partner one that can help practices and physicians be successful
under the terms of this agreement strata will be the exclusive distributor of nordlys systems for three years with an automatic extension out to a five-year term if minimum sales targets are achieved
good morning and welcome to the ppl corporation fourth quarter earnings conference call
regarding twenty eighteen i'll focus my prepared remarks this morning on the full year results please refer to the news release for additional details
there have not been significant changes to our uk capital plans as those have already been accepted by ofgem through the end of riio-ed one as we think about future spending beyond the current price control period
we continue to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareowners and we will continue to deliver long-term value for those who invest in ppl that concludes our prepared remarks
who has a wealth of experience with over twenty five years at wpd i have great confidence in phil's ability to lead our tremendous team there
also in twenty eighteen we continue to invest in our employees developing the pipeline of future leaders and fostering a more inclusive and encouraging innovation among our employees
and the reduction in tax benefits on holding company interest expense due to the lower federal tax rate resulting from us tax reform
and to continue the company's proven track record of outstanding execution established by robert over the past twenty years
we closed the year with strong operational and financial results as announced earlier today we achieved the high end of our twenty eighteen ongoing earnings forecast range
in addition and for the second straight year ppl electric posted its best year ever for safety
moving to slide three our agenda this morning begins with a brief overview of twenty eighteen results and ppl's business outlook for twenty nineteen i'll also provide a brief update on key regulatory developments
as one of america's best employers in twenty eighteen our pennsylvania operations were also recognized as best places to work for disability inclusion
turning to slide six we wanted to clarify and outline some observations about ofgem's recent riio-two consultation document
in the next few weeks and be able to be in a position to announce that i cannot comment on the proposed terms of the partnership of about what we've actually put in today's asx statement
so if you could just explain that and the other thing is on your traction motor i'm just wondering if you could just clarify if this is the -- if you have one model and this is going into a particular
in the life pensions and investment space market volatility has impacted new business flows over the past six months
our buy-to-let book is well seasoned with nine out of ten of those mortgages
i'll now conclude by summarizing the key highlights of our financial performance in the last six months
we effectively talk about three parts of that program we talk about reviewing or reducing the liabilities
we will also be referring to certain non-gaap financial measures additional information regarding these measures can be found in the slides labeled non-gaap financial information at the end of the presentation
slide three shows the agenda for today's review following the formal presentation we will be pleased to take your questions
primarily driven by the addition of new business and operating efficiencies slide seven shows the quarterly results for our two product segments
as i mentioned in my opening slide we've been investing in our business for a long time now and slide sixteen highlights the significant investments we have made
ray has thirty years of experience with lear including several international assignments he has led both product segments and most recently transformed our seating business into the fastest growing and most profitable seat supplier in the industry
in between the two is what looked a little odd and -- hey all the more power to you it looks great that you're picking up that additional business i was just curious if
slide six shows the financial highlights for the fourth quarter our positive momentum continues with record sales record core operating earnings and record adjusted earnings per share
e-systems accounts for forty percent of the backlog as we continue to increase market share
with the team that we have built the investments we have made in both two outstanding business segments we are perfectly positioned for continued profitable growth
ev so like ray said the backlog is very strong in these areas we've had a lot of success in all the regions
for all your hard work and dedication it's been an honor and a pleasure to serve as your ceo these past six years i'm leaving in peace because i know we have the right ceo in ray scott
much better than anything that's available on the market today we're averaging about one to two seconds on signal communication versus about thirty seconds
the fourth quarter in those two markets will definitely be softer than they otherwise would be and that will start to dissipate well probably the first quarter will be a little softer
i think those two markets are comparatively larger for berkeley point than they are for newmark taken as a whole
as you know we sold one business to nasdaq and we sold another business to the new york stock exchange
our growth was also driven by solid performance from our fenics fully electronic business
that was not included in our retax pre -- in our recast pretax earnings for the fourth quarter of twenty sixteen we expect our provision for taxes on distributable earnings
an improved operating profitability in financial services was led by the cost synergies we delivered over the course of last two years
with two of these combined into one paper in the new england journal of medicine along with one analytical verification and two clinical utility studies
in this quarter we executed five new contracts through regence blue cross
pivotal clinical validation data from our multi-center prospective brave trial for the envisia classifier were presented at the american thoracic society conference in may
and so the improvement there and the performance of the product is something that has a lot of clinicians really excited about the afirma gsc and wanting to gain some experience with it so we're really happy with that
we are not changing our production guidance range for two thousand and eighteen we have made significant steps to reduce our transportation costs in colombia
which make us a natural partner for the governments the communities and the contractors where we operate we seek to operate at the highest levels of hse performance and ethical compliance
a number of development wells at quifa southwest originally planned for the first half of two thousand and eighteen have been deferred to the second half of the year
should we expect sales to ramp up to the full amount of roughly eighty six hundred barrels a day and once the pipeline repairs are completed since you have oil in storage there and
comments on that and then i'll hand over to david to talk about ebitdar and the cash balance i think the simple answer on
higher oil prices which result in lower volumes relating to pap at quifa southwest
during the restructuring of frontera in late two thousand and sixteen second priority is to improve the quality of our existing upstream business
my four priorities since taking over as the ceo in april of this year have been the following
we are currently at sixoh oh zero feet and the well should be complete by the middle of august with evaluation and testing operations set for the end of august
as we progress through two thousand and eighteen we will continue to identify and evaluate areas for continued efficiency gains in our operations and improve our cost structure
the four hundred ten basis point improvement in operating margin over the same quarter last year
on the forty eight-volt front the deployment of our products in data center is expected to be delayed beyond calendar two thousand seventeen due to a change in requirements for the targeted lead project
we are increasing revenue across multiple product categories at a major us mobility oem and we have grown content in audio and standard products
come down from the thirty percent or so we had in the previous years probably slowly
but i think that in terms of the technical merits of the forty eight-volt architecture that we have presented to our customer and to the market now are good
for every single geography -- every single oem in all the geographies that i mentioned in the prepared remarks
and not really being affected by the fact that somebody has two or three product lines that they're selling together to a customer that's been at least my experience so i don't think that's going to have a
this gives us flexibility to support our customer as they switch production to the galaxy s seven given our overall performance in the quarter and our view forward
in smartphones outside of the two largest oems we expect consumer revenue will be down in the december quarter with lower revenue at our leading customer
distribution of the control to the factory floor was something that we could see coming almost five or six years ago so we were preparing the products for it
on the flip side for whatever comes out next could that mean you get some increased content on the -- whatever the note eight or whatever the next generation is
try to get it down a few more days to get at sixty or a couple days below that and we are
we do have -- and in that market obviously we do have our forty eight-volt initiatives but we do have twelve-volt products as well that can
i'm proud of our first quarter results as each of our businesses delivered strong operating performance and increased ebitda despite the slower-than-expected pace of us housing starts in the first quarter
first quarter new home sales were fifteen percent above fourth quarter levels and march sales were the highest in nearly eighteen months
and in those instances where we're over a hundred percent we don't look at that as a cause for panic we've got levers that we can pull there are some
western housing starts increased thirty percent in march compared with february as rain and snow receded and we are hearing of increased demand for cement and rebar in a number of areas signs that foundations are being poured
and overall economic fundamentals remain positive with increasing real wages unemployment at fifty-year lows and strong job growth in key housing markets
we did defer a little bit of silviculture in q one that's going to get pushed to q two so that's about half of it the other half is really just around timing of vessel shipments and so
nor are we expecting a meaningful decrease and so it would more or less on par with kind of how we've been tracking in q one is how we're currently seeing it
in twenty eighteen we harvested a greater proportion of our annual volume during the first quarter
comparing our first quarter results with the year ago quarter ebitda decreased significantly due to lower average realizations
turning to our real estate energy and natural resources segment second quarter earnings and adjusted ebitda will be lower than the first quarter
we will discuss non-gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of gaap can be found in the earnings materials on our website
average realizations for our southern logs increased approximately three percent as extremely wet weather limited log supply and drove improved realizations for sawlogs and pulpwood across most of the south
strong real estate activity in the fourth quarter of twenty eighteen allowed us to pursue additional transactions that closed in the first quarter
that generally will work itself out over the course of the year as it typically does and so i don't think you should look at q one cash flow really and annualize that that wouldn't be a typical way to do it
does it in particular make sense to maybe generate some additional cash for share repurchases just given where the stock trades relative to nav so
and the second question is is there a meaningful way in which you can differentiate yourselves in a five G world how do you think about
mandates for voo to be honest i think for the time being we do not see that there will be
free application what you see there is that in dta  the bundle goes down for a while and then people start using the data more and more and more
i think that in a nutshell sums it up and very good acquisition but that's much more recent since the focus of q four was on that conversion
we're taking a two-step approach for the connection in the home i mean the physical connection in the home it is when we're opening the roads and when we are active in the streets we offer the various customers
and we anticipate being ready by the end of this quarter to take gmp products for our customers
which would have driven more q four business had we been in better shape in those businesses
in terms of new store productivity it's actually been fairly stable over the last five years since we've entered the midwest so
as usual these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about ten older stores
before we begin the question-and-answer session i'd like to thank john call for his leadership and the numerous contributions he has made over more than two decades at ross
our recent stock prices with new repurchase program represents about eight percent of the company's total market share
for a protocol violation after he received an unrelated vaccination for shingles just before his second dose of sel-two one two his uric acid level had been fully controlled over the first month
thank you william and thanks to all of you who are joining us this afternoon within the past hour we issued our q four press release and also posted some slides that we'll be referring to on today's conference call
before i turn the call over to them we'd like to refer you to slide two on the presentation and advise that certain remarks we make during this call about the company's future expectations plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements
so we developed stopping rules for our phase ii trial and further we find them in the first part of the trial
correlating with the lower dose of the uricase enzyme but control is still solidly below ohsix mgs per deciliter one patient shown third here reached the trial stopping rules
as you may recall we previously said that we expected our existing cash to be sufficient to take us into the first quarter of two thousand eighteen based upon the payments we received from spark in december
most of these individuals are well served by oral medications that are in the market such as allopurinol however our market research indicates that more than half million patients in us
we initiated our phase ii trial in the fourth quarter while we remain in the early stages of this trial we have been emboldened by its progress and by the patient data that has been generated thus far
multiple serum samples have been collected from all patients for the measurement of ada levels and the analysis of these samples is currently on going
all but one of the remaining patients in this cohort had received a third dose as of march twenty three and there have been no saes reported in this cohort
this work has led us to begin planning with nci for a potential combination
werner during the first part of the trial we refined the stopping rules and while we were doing that some of the patients missed the dozing window around the twenty eight days
for the same period in two thousand and fifteen the decrease in net loss per share in the most recent quarter
within two thousand seventeen we reset several business strategies and tactics to enable greater value production shipments
for example to serve some portions of this market we are developing technologies such as mems and other game-changer solutions
during the first quarter of twenty eighteen wells fargo bank extended our credit line agreement which had been originally set to mature
there's two major drivers that we are looking at for growth organically
you have certain flows that are qualified in certain fabs and newport beach was the initial flagship for all of the rf soi products also
a very big difference than the rf soi but on the margin side it's a very big difference
that go well beyond the performance possible with today's rf soi processes and will provide us a strong competitive advantage
this part of the power management market addresses about fifty percent of the overall pm market and supports many end applications
the one deals with three hundred-millimeter where we've stated that one of our growth engines for the second half of the year
so i -- it's a little bit hard for me to commit to that although i think there is one customer that is desirous to press release with us on what they're doing at three hundred-millimeter but for the most part i think it's just to track the revenue and listen to the calls watch the numbers
should be given to us is fifty percent of the capacity of the factory
into zte that have an impact sit among our customer base
on the forecast at the beginning of two thousand and nineteen we will decide to invest to increase capacity in that factory
that's why we have the confidence of the greater than the twenty five percent but it's really based on what the customers are telling us and our judgment of the reliability of the customer and their own markets and their position in their own markets
the math that i just gave the arithmetic i just gave you'd see that the fourth quarter of 'eighteen is
moving to page -- to slide seventeen as we have already noted last year we noted that we were coming off the back of a significant period of expansion for a number of customers
and will deliver new revenues in fy 'nineteen and beyond as these projects are commissioned
connecting more gas resources will definitely help with putting downward pressure on prices and that is what apa does and continues to do well
this group has also been tasked with establishing a secondary pipeline capacity trading platform the trading platform builds on the work that apa has done to develop innovative capacity trading products for shippers to readily trade their capacity
the growth that might be expected for the business in fy 'eighteen because we don't have a number of
the range in ebitda is generally attributable to the discretionary business that we -- that our customers do with us
the gas market reform group is also implementing the earlier decision by the coag energy council
what we've done in fy 'seventeen confirms that our long-standing strategy of delivering connected and sustainable energy solutions
owning more of this sort of dynamic kit along with the likes of our gas processing and storage assets and our renewable energy assets will see sib capex at higher levels going forward
during the year but we feel comfortable with this range and that new revenues will begin to flow off this year's capital projects in two thousand and nineteen and beyond
long-term investors on the call are well familiar with apa's views on this australia has sufficient and significant gas resources
on slide six we have listed the tools that apa has at its disposal that are enabling a more liquid and affordable gas market
we anticipate corporate costs can be kept at or around these fy 'seventeen levels going forward with the current business mix
reflects that the net number of people who left the island from september two thousand seventeen to
before i cover the highlights for two thousand eighteen i am pleased to report that today we announced a series of planned capital actions that we intend to execute this year
these investments achieve more attractive after-tax yields without adding credit risk or materially changing the characteristics of the investment portfolio the overall duration of the bond portfolio is still under three years
please turn to slide twelve we continue to improve our leading market position in puerto rico which puts us in a strong position to take advantage of future opportunities
our plan is to continue with our strategy of becoming a pure-play gp and not owning fixed assets upstairs
but -- so that's what is connected to our target of fifteen percent to twenty percent in the gp or teekay parent dividend
we likewise aren't losing money when oil is down at -- in the forty s and fifties and so we -- but obviously everyone is concerned about the energy market now but
and so we continue to see that our offshore and our lng markets will continue to grow albeit not as fast as people had thought
this vessel is currently providing ammonia transportation services under a ten-year charter with potash corporation
well most -- what i always ask people is what was the price of oil ten years ago
which they are going to take up at their december board meeting the amount that we receive as twenty six percent owner is not that significant compared to the amount we receive
with the anticipated sale of the remaining six offshore and shipping assets
well it's really two different things one is what you just said which is that we already have enough growth in the book
that the whole energy space has been affected we saw this in 'oh nine and that's why we're trying to stress the stability of our niche in the energy market
as was the case last year and will be for the next several years the vast majority of our capital investments relate to cpg's extensive inventory of growth in modernization projects
with recent legislation extending bonus depreciation we do not expect to pay cash federal income taxes until two thousand and twenty three due to the intensity of our capital investment program
and as we've noted on a number of occasions we expect those projects will result in a tripling of cpg's net investment level
finally and notably in december we filed a customer agreement with the ferc to extend our columbia gas transmission
with that i'd like to look forward and take a moment to discuss our twenty sixteen financial guidance
the path act back in december what that would mean for you i just want to clarify i think when you had put out the original presentation in may you had assumed no expansions
moving to slide nine as a direct result of our strategic partnership with gds during the second quarter we signed leases totaling more than ten megawatts with two chinese hyperscale customers
upon completion of the projects in the pipeline and the closing of the zenium transaction the size of our portfolio will be more than four million colocation square feet
yes and we're sitting on almost four hundred acres of land inventory for future development
in addition some of the company's remarks this morning contain non-gaap financial measures you can find reconciliations of those measures to the most comparable gaap measures
which is less than the run rate in the prior two quarters as a result of lower straight-line rent adjustments in the second quarter
road map is really unclear once they get out beyond five years about how much of their it kit
as slide five highlights this was a phenomenal leasing quarter and as i just mentioned we set a number of records the revenue signed was more than double the prior four-quarter average and through the first half of the year we have signed more revenue than we did all of last year
while that processes is obviously taking longer than we had hoped we anticipate that we will receive approval in the next couple of months and this would give us a presence in london and frankfurt the two large data center markets in europe
in terms of any other reit product type and even in terms of our returns to some of our competition those are really off the chart even with a bit of compression in the unlevered returns for the cloud deals
providing an attractive comprehensive solution for our customers and seventy percent of our revenue is from customers in multiple locations throughout our portfolio
for two thousand and eighteen with the exception of the increase in our metered power reimbursements range the changes to our ranges are attributable to a change in our assumption
bookings for the group was up fifty percent versus last year and i think that's just giving a broad amount of indication for just how strong this is
the press release and the information on this call speak only as of today's date and the company disclaims any duty to update the information provided therein and herein i will now turn the call over to gregg mollins president and ceo of reliance
in regard to energy the general consensus from our customer base throughout the country is more positive today than it was ninety days ago
we were very pleased with our ability to sustain our strong gross profit margin throughout two thousand and sixteen our fifo gross profit margin
turning to our outlook given the positive sentiment for both metal pricing and demand in early two thousand and seventeen we are optimistic in regard to both business activity levels and metal pricing
but in late two thousand and fourteen we placed a renewed focus on properly pricing the value we provide to our customers
assuming no significant changes in market conditions we believe that we can sustain a reported lifo gross profit margin
while overall demand for metal products was not as strong as we expected when we entered two thousand and sixteen customer sentiment has improved
looking ahead to two thousand seventeen we expect to continue executing on our balanced capital allocation strategy that includes growth through both acquisitions and organic investments
where we experienced healthy volume growth in twenty sixteen based on these trends our outlook for the aerospace market remains positive
common alloy aluminum conversion pricing has remained fairly stable as did our volume levels in two thousand and sixteen most of our common alloy aluminum products are sold to sheet metal fabricators that support a variety of end markets
this focus and effort produced six consecutive quarters of fifo gross profit margin improvement
and was in line with our guidance of down five percent to seven percent we had expected our average selling price to decline one percent to three percent in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter
please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today for a reconciliation of our non-gaap adjustments
to say that we're going to be sustainable at thirty percent is probably a little bit of a reach
has now kind of stabilized versus what it was like again in the past five years
but it may not and it really depends on the circumstance at the time and it might different if it's one year from now
yes so the color is there is really no color which is to say if you were to go back over the course of the last eight quarters and take
secondly on apac i'm just wondering if it might be premature to ask the question having sort of just got back into quarterly profit but can you just touch on the things that
was three four percent as we secured more contracts and executed at a better level
we signed an agreement to purchase the assets of tennessee rv supercenter we expect the acquisition to close before the end of the calendar year this dealership will be branded lazydays of knoxville after the close
let me provide you an update on the milestones we achieved since we last spoke ninety days ago
does it make sense to maybe look even further strategically between the two businesses i don't know maybe if you could just talk a little bit about
with no major tranches of debt coming due until twenty twenty when we think about leveraging economies of scale and experience as a company we have spent the last five years developing the necessary assets around our software
today our debt is actually lower than where we were two years ago and yet our portfolio has changed significantly and it's a portfolio that has shifted to growth
in addition we now have closed three platform deals with our global systems integrators these deals are a managed service and have the opportunity
the pitney bowes of tomorrow will continue to evolve i anticipate that our conversations a year from now will be different just as they are different today from five years ago
primarily driven by the addition of newgistics which was not in our results last year and accounts for six points of the drop
so we expect an improved performance in q four versus the previous quarter as a result of the holiday season
we took on a ten-year take-or-pay agreement for a new supply connection and terminal in the central kansas uplift
liquids line in the country that moves about two million barrels a day of refined products up from louisiana up to washington dc and maybe even up into new york harbor
we have the best service we're connected now to or will be connected now to three refineries which give direct take away off of the pipe improved markets
contracted and designed at eight hundred million a day once you get into service and you start to see how it runs and you see how the gas -- where the gas is going and where it's coming from and how the turbines are behaving
or measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap with that let me now turn the call over to david for his opening remarks
particularly what we have found in the middle of the system is that you're seeing supply optionality is becoming a focus point for a lot of those folks and so the utilities are looking at a connection with rex
and one month of results from the powder river gathering system that was acquired in early june
we found out that there was a demand in the dj et cetera and that's why we ended up building the necl piece kind of simultaneously and
and the power plants and industrial customers are looking at a connection with rex that allows them to access both the
i know you've still get two other jv partners on that is there a chance that this ends up as a wholly owned asset is that something that's kind of on the radar as low hanging fruit or is money better spent elsewhere right now
the eight hundred million a day that was anticipated on the power up project
we do not expect to file the k before the sec deadline of march sixteen as a result the company has requested from nasdaq
the mou was signed in parallel with the approval of an exclusivity agreement with brookfield asset management to negotiate a possible business transaction
another extension of time to regain compliance with applicable nasdaq reported requirements
it should be noted that we have not yet completed and filed our annual report for the full year two thousand sixteen so the numbers shown remain as estimates
in march twenty fifteen with an agreement with a regional marketer to export our crude by a truck to international markets
in light of this -- in light of the disruptions at the border and very low realization on truck exports at the prevailing benchmark prices the mnr recommended that hawler crude should only be sold by the kurdistan export pipeline
the size of any funding required for the balance of twenty fifteen will be a function of planned activity production levels and revenue at that time
by reentering and completing one or two of the previously drilled exploration wells and drilling a new well
we have solidified our financial position by securing funding for our plan twenty sixteen activities and by restructuring contingent consideration liabilities to align payments
scope of the first phase of the project will likely include the construction and new production facilities and the recompletion of one or two previously drilled exploration wells and potentially the drilling of one new well
rex american resources assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements
this reflects the lower operating performance of these plants consistent with the industry this year versus last year and the fact that we stopped recognizing equity income on the patriot plant at may thirty one two thousand and fifteen upon the close of that sale
we've also taken delivery of all four additional leased haul trucks in our plan and that provides us with the truck haulage capacity needed in the first couple of years when the waste movement is at its highest
earlier this afternoon we released our press release with summary results for our twenty sixteen fiscal year including a table showing our results by segment which separately breaks out our xcede loss
all of this potential revenue is difficult to predict and forecast financially but does represent examples of technology within rmd which could be spun out
well so you can see right here that it's in these three products that we've shown you a picture of
this required a supplemental funding to keep the company alive through february twenty seventeen and a request to our development partner cook biotech to assist with the first-in-human clinical trials
which has resulted in what could potentially -- which was previously a ten- to fifteen-hour tuning project to get these things back in the field has reduced that time down to less than an hour
what essentially happened in the contract research business in twenty sixteen was
how soon till that might get to the point that it could offset the losses from the continuing fda trials here
that is a program where we are jointly developing with two other partners replacement
the devaluation of major latam currencies in the third quarter accounted for a significant share of the fx impact you have seen in our sales line and it was actually more pronounced than we had expected still in summer
preferred supplier during the rollout phase as i recall historically that was a role that you were able to keep for at least two to maybe even three years post the launch of the plants before they considered
we will continue to invest but despite these investments given our cost focus and the history that you've seen in the last three to four years
and indeed we saw some substantial hardware placements in q two which i called out
and have you actually got the numerical data for just the intermediate and poor risk groups in javelin for a similar cutoff and maybe
and cannot be compensated by the good performance we continue to expect for the three other
we have for sure an upside here from the dollar in h one so i hope this clarifies what guided us when we were adjusting the currency assumptions
explicit and you will see that in all three business sectors we have a clearly over-proportionate impact on the bottom line compared to the top line effect which by nature drives down the margin
we also saw another visible pickup in momentum compared to an already strong q two sales of mavenclad and bavencio continued to rise and our opportunity in general medicine franchises grew yet again strongly
secondly due to the strong oled growth that we have experienced in the third quarter of
for a detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that affect the company's business and that qualifies as forward-looking statements made on this call i refer you to our periodic and other public filings filed with the sec
and the willingness of casdin to enter into a one-year lockup on these shares underscores their long-term fundamental investment strategy now i'd like to turn the call back over to mike
in closing q two was an operational and financial success and continued evidence of our ability to efficiently manage the business in a period of sustained high growth
we hit seventy percent so in terms of where it can go dylan i really don't want to get into that i want to see the next few quarters as we maintain these levels of production and perhaps even increase them
well it does include some people in the qc area it includes some additional customer support people based on the increased activity on a revenue basis
we believe our proprietary biopreservation media products have been used in more than three hundred customer clinical applications
and the estimated enrollment of that again is somewhere around thousand patients or so
as a reminder this call is being recorded and broadcast live on our website a replay of the webcast will be available through the same link for ninety days
with respect to our outlook for the full year of two thousand and eighteen as we noted in our preliminary revenue release in early july
that's correct we're running one shift in one clean room we are in the process of opening up the second clean room and that -- there are costs associated with that that will definitely fall into the third and fourth quarters
and which is a pressure on net interest margins is the whole lcr regime or the liquidity coverage ratio regime
in terms of the margins and i do hope and believe that the rbi in due course will reduce
which is now in the hands of the regulator to moderate as we go into two thousand eighteen for the rest of the year so i hope that answers broadly your question
and i think we need to keep in mind that from january one this liquidity coverage ratio has moved to ninety percent so banks had to start preparing in the second half of the third quarter towards
we had indicated that within a period of eighteen months which is by september eighteenth we would be double the number which is at about sixteen million-plus customers
and we therefore see the casa journey continuing to be pretty robust and strong
we would be competing we were competing heavily of course with surplus liquidity banks but also with wholesale funded institutions who are able to compete and bring down the rates for the last one year
with the space around i think it's a very long tail business we are talking of a very large base of assets all of which will probably be available over the next six to twelve months really so we are patiently going ahead with that really
so let's say ordinarily if you had grown at fifteen percent if you start growing only at about that rate that is the time when you cut down and you come back to the normal rate
from an order booking point of view do you think that will be maintained or are we in such a volatile period that you can't really say that about what's going to happen in q one well
we have eighteen different platforms there are numerous opportunities to further reduce the cost by changing certain designs
historically that has been the case to overtake growth of the other two drivers in the industry so
it's been two weeks since we have been pre-released the key figures for the first half year so i will keep my comments on the figures short today
the adjustment is not the result of the actual performance in the first six months but reflect our current expectation of bookings in the months ahead
at a comparable discount rate at fifteen months ago and at the same volume of pension commitments our equity ratio is now significantly higher
the ebit which is relevant for the dividend payment will come in several hundred million euros higher than the adjusted ebit we use for our forecast
where would you be -- where do you think this is going to go in terms of twenty sixteen are you more confident that's something that they can see reality and
the way your tactics played out in q two it looks like there was more focus on market share preservation rather than profitability
the impact of the benefits from the revenue synergies and cost programs will grow in two thousand and seventeen and we feel we've made very good progress against all of our objectives so let me highlight some of these accomplishments in more detail
most importantly we have to keep focusing on our clients carry forward the financial disciplines initiated in two thousand and sixteen and continue to work collaboratively as we build and improve our go-to-market strategies
as we've been discussing two thousand sixteen was a year of building a new organization a new way to address our clients' needs and developing strong focus on financial management
across the board on the savings initiatives which now -- you mentioned two of the elements and the third element is the business restructuring
we don't have a similar really big one that we are implementing this year we're still going to get up to a hundred ten thousand retirees
we expect the mid-market to continue adopt at a faster pace than the large companies we anticipate the revenue growth to slow a little bit in two thousand seventeen but continue to feel good about the momentum of this business in the long term
constant currency and organic revenue will be aligned as we now have a full year of results for all of the two thousand fifteen acquisitions
integration expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our gaap measures
i think we've succeeded in building this foundation and i expect to see our financial performance momentum grow in two thousand and seventeen now i'll hand it back to john
right at the same level as our competitors so we feel good about this going into two thousand and seventeen when we look at the outlook for two thousand and seventeen i think the thing that we would most focus on is this is probably
i think frustrated is the right word that it was -- we had these good savings we were getting in oip and for one reason they weren't dropping to the bottom line and i think one of the things we said to the analyst and investor community was
perhaps one of the most important developments of two thousand sixteen was confirmation of the merger rationale
while the two thousand and sixteen revenue performance may not fully reflect our integration and sales efforts the commitment i see from our colleagues throughout the organization and the steps we've taken to build the framework for long-term success
i'd like to add my thanks to our colleagues around the globe for all their efforts during twenty sixteen as we take a step back and consider the progress we've made in just twelve months
how much saving will that be in two thousand and seventeen yes i'd say in terms of the individual amounts and
if we have a closer look at the growth we see a total growth of more than seven percent but if we then deduct the
so we expect some of that contributed to the ten percent because like you said that's a big swing for our market
these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure is available in our fourth quarter two thousand and eighteen earnings release
outside of las vegas our aquarius property has maintained ebitda in laughlin where the market experienced some decline in visitation towards the end of the year as well as tight local employment
in other areas and then we could really evaluate how we think about the other two prongs of returning capital to our stakeholders
we're also working in parallel with our clinical cro that is our full contract research organization
i will now turn the call over to andy to provide more details on our second fiscal quarter two thousand seventeen results as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year andy
obligation being denominated in euro versus us dollar we do need to mark to market that adjustment
we used our over one million square feet of distribution capacity and deep partner relationships
because our sellers are compensated on gross profit we maintained strong profitability in line with last year's first quarter achieving first quarter records for adjusted ebitda and non-gaap net income per share
and even green space a recent example of the power of this solution is one where we helped a major midwestern university with five campuses enhance connectivity across its entire operation
given uk and canadian operations now represent roughly ten percent of our business it is important to consider currency translation when modeling both top and bottom line in this volatile currency environment
and i think that's as much a driver as win ten relative to what's going on with the notebook world
these excellent results did not include sales of the client devices we discussed last quarter that were delayed at the end of two thousand and sixteen as shipping did not begin until april
to date uk is not seeing significant changes in customer buying behavior even with the uncertainty related to timing and terms of brexit we also continue to see excellent referral progress
canada is executing well in the face of uncertainty as both businesses and governments assess the potential economic impact from any changes in us trade policy as well as potential changes in oil pricing
market trends remained similar to what we saw throughout twenty sixteen with ongoing focus on optimization efficiency securitization and the integration of software into solutions
it took a full year from the rfp issuance to inking the deal and as you would expect competition was heavy we won because of our experience and connected campus solution
an additional month of interest on the six percent notes that were redeemed was partially offset by interest savings from the recent refinancing
remember since we add back equity compensation expenses for non-gaap net income the tax benefits related to equity compensation will also be excluded from our non-gaap net income
comes the expectation that they will be connected everywhere any time from dorm room to classroom from dining hall to the quad this is where cdw's connected campus solution comes in
we have no further updates since the last conference call we continue to cooperate fully with the sec and although we cannot predict the outcome based on what we know to date we do not expect this matter to have a material impact on the company
and therefore develop solutions for those segments if you remember back on the early days of the common core curriculum and cdw being kind of first to market with a prepackaged solution
one external factor that has changed since our last call is foreign exchange which we now expect to be near zero for the full year based on current fx rates
be shipped convert to ar and then from ar to cash so getting that through both stages by year end is the question and that depends on
our q two free cash flow was below our target as working capital builds pushed our total working capital to twenty eight percent of sales
is the rest of the difference between where you were in 'sixteen and where you want to be in 'seventeen adjusting for higher profits and things effectively working capital or is there anything else in there there's no swing in tax paid or anything like that
but all in all i would say that we are very satisfied with the development of cash flow bringing the leverage below two turns
will kill me almost if i don't mention that they are very close to being a top ten country ebit-wise now
the drip program enables shareholders to acquire additional subordinated voting shares from cara by reinvesting all of their cash dividends the shares purchased will be issued at a discount from the market price of those shares
looking forward we expect to be challenged with lower revenues in the next quarter because of lower volumes and project completions these revenue swings have been an inherent challenge in our cs business which we are trying to address strategically
we have a us entity and we got global operating subsidiaries right
and it's this good advice that we baked into our new fouroh release on the mediamiser front thanks to
on the iads front we'll start with synodex our digital data product that improves both the efficiency and the accuracy of life insurance underwriting by applying digital technologies to healthcare information
are the net result of a mature content services business with approximately thirty percent project base revenues
o'neil has just provided a detailed financial review of the quarter and the year as well as our revenue outlook for q one i will now provide some additional insight into the business of each of our reporting segments
our goal is to shrink this loss in each of the next successive quarters and to get to ebitda breakeven by q four of this year
rather than working against us as it did in q four since most of our customers were paying then in canadian dollars will start to work for us
i know you're not providing guidance for 'sixteen but i'm curious do you think that with respect to not providing that guidance at this point does it make sense to
our discussion today includes certain non-gaap financial measures which provide additional information that we believe is helpful to investors
we have scrubbed our production forecast for the remainder of the year and while our outlook has been reduced we still have an expectation of a higher fourth quarter over both q three and last year
think that you'd see organic growth maybe in the first half of next year based on the trends that you've seen so far and what you anticipate for q four as i look out into twenty sixteen i'd still remain bullish in terms of
on october one we closed our acquisition of priamus system technologies priamus is a technology leader in the development of advanced process control systems for the plastic injection molding industry
i want to mention relative to the performance of the oem side of the business in aerospace
you will find a reconciliation table on our website as part of our press release and in the form eight-k submitted to the sec
as a result of this decision a contract termination dispute has arisen and we have recorded a pretax charge of two point eight million during the quarter
in late september this same customer announced its decision to dissolve its fifty-fifty joint venture with american airlines which is a major engine overhaul shop
for those who accept the offer there will be a payout in december of twenty fifteen which will be made out of existing plan assets
the combination of new security option a completely new operating system and changes in application infrastructure appears to have caused it departments to proceed cautiously and therefore more slowly
desktop security and iot we believe the emm market remained solid we continue to deliver features that differentiate us from our competitor and we have plenty of room to grow in the category
with regard to non-gaap financial metrics while we believe them to be helpful in understanding mobileiron's financial performance they are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable gaap metrics
during the second quarter we had a large mrc customer convert to a term subscription in order to achieve cost savings by moving to a fixed term contract
with our continued focus on driving operational improvements as well as getting paid fair value for our products and services we're encouraged by the additional opportunities that still exist to resume margin growth in twenty eighteen and beyond
while there has been some brexit-related softness in general -- in the general uk economy that has impacted the housing market we believe there is good growth potential over the longer term given the housing demographics
turning to slide thirteen this illustrates the significantly improved results we are now seeing from our architectural business
turning to slide eight expanding and optimizing our business portfolio have also been an emphasis over the last several years to positively impact both top and bottom line growth
higher volumes from the merchant and contractor remodel channels were offset by softness in the builder channel due in part to continued general weakness amongst the top uk builders which comprise the majority of our revenues in this channel
on balance we anticipate that us reform could be favorable to our book tax rate by anywhere from one to five percentage points
we're seeing a lot of suppliers still looking to try to claw back losses they've seen with transactional FX incurred over the last eighteen months the other factor that we see is wage inflation
our discussion of operating performance will include non-gaap financial measures within the meaning of sec regulation g
adjusted ebitda margin in this business has grown for six consecutive quarters with a quickening trend in the second half of two thousand seventeen as pricing actions and cost savings from the closure of the algoma plant took hold
let's turn to annuities on slide twelve annuities are a core enablement capability for our wealth management business and part of our important set of solutions tailored to meet our clients' needs
this is over ninety percent of our adjusted operating earnings this demonstrates our ongoing commitment to capital return as well as confidence and our risk analytics and future cash flow capacity
this includes enhancing our digital and financial planning capabilities as well as upgrading to an advanced crm system so our advisers can work in an even more integrated way with their clients
i would actually even add a little more color to that because it was a very strong quarter it is in our third quarter we have our national conference which takes our top fifteen percent of advisers away for a week and some extend mainly for two weeks
and engagement and so this is one of the things i am really excited about as we move into 'nineteen and i think it could be a big opportunity for us
another critical fact point is the seventy five percent of claims experience provides statistically valid information that is used in estimating our reserve assumptions
a discussion of risks and uncertainties is included in our form ten-q and other sec filings
okay i think just to follow up with that and finalize with this but i mean you mentioned your win rates are doubling in those large contracts i mean is that from these specific areas maybe if you could list to us maybe the top three areas that you think you differentiate versus your competitors
but we really think this is a growing area of market leadership for csc and we are planning to continue to invest in this business as we go forward
and in the past quarter we did make progress against all three of these key objectives
we continue to expect stronger earnings in the second half of the year as we realize synergies related to uxc and xchanging and we benefit from other cost initiatives
but the big difference there is uxc that's why we bought uxc was we were going to gain a significant presence
on the slides on slide two you'll see that certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking
to the strengthening of the dollar against the pound and the euro as well as our investments in the bps platform as we just mentioned however
and is accretive to our overall margin profile of csc so that was one of the reasons why this became apparent to us last year in particular
and following on that i think you mentioned in your q one report that one of the factors driving increased profitability
the relevance of the project in -- six weeks ago at one of the
i will refer you to the company's sec filings for more detailed discussions of the risks and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today
and a sixteen percent increase in the average selling price versus the prior year
we are extremely pleased to have undertaken this important step in our company's growth and i think it fits with our organizational dna to be leaders rather than followers in all that we do
we had a tale of two segments with the west accounting for the entirety of this improvement while we continue to strengthen our position in the southeast
in two thousand and sixteen compared to two thousand and fifteen this is encouraging and speaks to our ability to meet the needs and wants of consumers with innovative design and high construction standards in locations where customers want to live
and still represent record levels moving to our land and inventory management on page eleven another factor
in twenty sixteen we are proud of this accomplishment which is in part due to the exceptional positioning of our communities in some of the best markets in the nation
into two thousand seventeen we plan to continue with our current objectives of momentum to grow revenue and discipline to prudently manage costs
before the call begins on page two i'd like to remind everyone that certain statements made in the course of this call constitute forward-looking statements
these high standards are enabling us to more efficiently balance our order pace in asp to build a healthy backlog position and improve returns
nearly all are below the national average in terms of supply and five of our eight markets have less than three months' supply
additionally in two thousand seventeen we are making a significant investment in our training and development marketing and our sales management and sales training efforts as i previously discussed
and our ongoing transformation of ucp into a consistently profitable company delivering improving returns on equity for our shareholders
to that end we have a higher mix of our new community pipeline weighted towards these two buyers segments
in the rate of our libor-based credit facility we had a negligible amount of capex during the quarter
if there's no opportunity to do that we can keep -- we can pay off our debt at the mlp and thirdly the other thing we can do then is tender for shares
for our company i have to say we are disappointed by the federal trade commission's decision to put us through a second request related to the proposed gpp-delek logistics joint venture to acquire terminal assets from american midstream
these numbers exclude any capital related to our high-protein ddg project which is still in the engineering and contracting phase
we're going to have -- what are you going to do with two oh oh million to three hundred million bushels of extra beans every single month except to push out storage
we along with delek through the jv have decided to terminate our agreement to acquire the amid terminal assets because there was no assurance we could overcome the regulatory obstacles from the ftc's review
and down in texas is that we both believe in the jv we can enhance the profitability through pushing our own volumes through as well as keeping third-party volumes flowing as well
next june one our -- i believe what we also have to put out there is the amount of gallons going into 'nineteen with the waiver
we expect in the next ninety days to be able to make announcements and discuss some of the things to achieve the goal that we outlined on may seven to you and it all remains on track and we continue to thank you for your patience and hopefully
in the fourth quarter we began drilling two wells in our prolific ruston field in north louisiana in addition we began drilling our northwest stack position in an attempt to delineate the play
though early we remain encouraged by both our and other operators' results in the northwest stack
additionally the team is pursuing growth on its existing gas and water business as well as crude gathering opportunities and new business opportunities in the northwest stack
this is the second straight quarter that riviera has beat guidance on adjusted ebitdax production and capital spending
finally our strong balance sheet gives us tremendous flexibility taken together riviera is set up for an exciting year in two thousand nineteen i will now turn the call over to dan to discuss the upstream operations in more detail
as i always do during the month of december i had a chance to visit four different countries on a trip that i plan every year with senior members of our buying and operations team
the calculation of this tax is quite complex and the measurement dates and requirements subject to further irs guidance
we expect that pricing pressures on revenue in two thousand sixteen will be offset at least in significant part through sharing of the burden with our china distributor and potentially through volume increases
despite these external factors we continue to see positive overall trends in our volume and value share for zadaxin underscoring our belief
which showed a survival advantage for sepsis patients treated with zadaxin we expect that data should be available in about three years
as we noted in our announcement of july one nine in the end those discussions ended without an offer that our board was willing to pursue
we continue to believe that DC bead has very positive revenue potential for sciclone our development portfolio continues to progress
and discussions with key opinion leaders and regulators about a possible accelerated pathway for the innovative antibiotic vibativ are continuing
our outlook for two thousand sixteen is influenced by several factors including the overall growth rate of china pharmaceuticals market anticipated pricing pressure on the provincial level
turning to slide three please refer to additional disclaimers related to the presentation of our financial information and our previously filed form eight-k
garrett was unaware of that action prior to honeywell's disclosure in its ten-q
we'd also like to mention that today's presentation uses numerous non-gaap terms to describe the way in which we manage and operate our business
we believe that these non-gaap financial measures assist management and investors in evaluating our performance and preparing period-to-period results of operations in a more meaningful and consistent manner as discussed in greater detail in the supplemental schedules to our earnings release
which we believe is a healthier option than what's currently in the market this innovative coffee drink contains fifteen grams of protein only two grams of sugar and eighty milligrams of caffeine
the net growth in volume points in q three was the largest in a single quarter since two thousand twelve and the second highest volume point quarter in total in the company's history
you mentioned something like seventy basis points of volume growth coming from test markets and you kind of went through that quickly i wasn't sure that i really understood what that related to
it's made from real coffee and contains no artificial flavors or added colors and best of all it's only a hundred calories providing nutrition and energy so many consumers are looking for as a snack or on the go
or to sell them together offering more flavor variety at a comparable price to our normal thirty serving size individual flavors
in australia and new zealand we introduced our first ever formula one select product
the volume point growth was again very broad based including double-digit growth in four of our top five markets for the second quarter in a row
with volume increasing nineteen percent compared to the third quarter of two thousand seventeen building on the positive trends we experienced during the first half of the year
in addition to a lot of prepared comments that we have what's most exciting is that you're going to have the opportunity to interact with almost twenty different executives and distributors
approximately zero currency impact that was included in our previous guidance estimate
the month the inventory was made and think of five months ago maybe as when the inventory was translated so you get actually a benefit sequentially from -- in the short term from a strengthening dollar
these strategies are coming to life through exciting innovative products like those we've recently launched all in all this quarter we launched a total of fifty eight products in fifty one countries as well as a few in the past couple of weeks that i want to share with you now
changing the way you think about pricing is that something that you might change going forward where you'll be pricing more in line with FX moves as opposed to waiting for sort of the inflation to catch up
as you see in the statement of cash flows which appears on page nineteen of our press release schedules
well the way i look at it is we -- all four of our businesses are run well and have done things over a number of years to position us well for long-term growth
the real upside for value creation is combining two successful organizations into an even more innovative and talented professional services firm
as part of the capital planning related to the jlt transaction it is unlikely we will repurchase any stock ahead of the close of the acquisition
now in the second half of two thousand and eighteen and particularly in the fourth quarter we did see much stronger demand than we've been expecting across the entire portfolio and that led to the stronger performance you've seen
dan has had two successful years leading the ir team and will soon be transitioning to a new role
we began incurring interest expense on this new debt as of january fifteen and we'll treat this expense as a noteworthy item net of interest income earned until the closing of the transaction
however in twenty nineteen we anticipate repurchasing enough stock to satisfy our commitment to reduce our share count each year
we have always included transaction amortization in our earnings and have consistently challenged ourselves to overcome that cost through value creation in our acquisition jlt doesn't change our perspective
and it is important to note that we will have meaningful representation of senior jlt colleagues at the executive committee level
growth in the quarter was driven by strong new business and retention the us and canada division continued its trend of strong growth delivering seven percent underlying revenue growth in the quarter
resulting from distribution elections made by participants in our uk plan
that said the integration of jlt will likely involve more adjustments to our numbers over the next two or three years than we have seen historically
and our visibility on backlog is typically somewhere between four weeks and three months depending on market conditions and the type of work we're selling
on power systems again growth across both of its core revenue streams of oe and services
for it to stop being dynamic ie at what point do you think okay we can draw a line under this it's not going to increase anymore or is there a risk that as we get through 'eighteen or 'nineteen you say well actually 'twenty is a bit worse
when we highlighted our new accounting policy we're capitalizing a little earlier and stopping capitalizing a little later than previously and the comparative for the first half of 'seventeen did not have that new accounting policy in place
and we're not anticipating those issues to occur on the ten because they're already a different design of turbine blade and they already have different coating
we are also modifying inventory for customers in order to deal with the changing regulations for lng fuel stations
a telephone replay of today's broadcast will be available following the conclusion of the call until thursday november three the replay information is contained in the company's earnings release
this excludes the impact from any restructuring costs and assumes an annual effective tax rate of thirty one percent i'll now turn the call over to sam thomas
we are seeing opportunities with quoting activity for a handful of new natural gas processing plants and feed studies for modular mid-scale lng export facilities
in my first ninety days i've spent a lot of time getting to know the business and understanding our operations but also working on initiatives to streamline our operations and make them more efficient
and you haven't seen it yet but you possibly do as you get into twenty seventeen i'd say it's a wait-and-see there may be some effect in the third quarter
compared with the third quarter of two thousand and fifteen the decline was due to continued weakness in upstream natural gas processing petrochemical and lng markets
as well as currency with the weakening chinese renminbi partially offsetting these reductions are improvements in europe which is continuing to see very healthy downstream lng activity
in addition the prior year quarter's rate was unusually high as a result of a reserve against certain accumulated tax loss balances which made up fifteen percentage points in the prior year quarter
like this one from a sort of profitability and volume angle for competitors do you think there's going to be a lot more attrition and opportunity for you to gain share and maybe pick up some depressed assets or how do you think about that going into twenty seventeen i
and it comes down to -- we're certainly encouraged by the sec to highlight and report gaap numbers
be likely to release some sort of a guide on cecl implications
so there is no magic to it it really was just those two things
the main factor was the increase in the outflow due to the acquisition of ppe as
while interest rates have increased and reit stock prices have contracted economic indicators remain sound and fundamentals in our business remain healthy
in line with the zip code we've been experiencing over the past few years as you know
call it in the mid-two S and i think that relationship with -- in terms of what we do with respect to annual bumps across all our leases and then where we've been signing cash rents i think with
forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainties which are discussed at length in our press releases as well as our sec filings
the decline in the midpoint is almost solely attributable to the unforeseen bankruptcy of a sixty two thousand square foot industrial user in greensboro
and then just with respect to 'nineteen i don't think we're in position to talk about specifics on
this is classified as a termination fee in the press release and in the table on page four in our supplemental package
finally as you know we will provide twenty nineteen guidance during our fourth quarter call but in the interim there are some items i would like to highlight
now i'll turn things over to cliff to discuss some of the operational highlights for the quarter and address how they impacted lmi's financial results
in 'eighteen and then i don't have gulfstream delivering until 'eighteen remind me when you're sending content to gulfstream for those first few deliveries how far out ahead that is and then for how many quarters do you think we see this
offset of four hundred business falling off and then partially offset by five hundred until that actually becomes revenue generating
and is that a requirement that you see to accomplish in 'seventeen to position yourself for that 'eighteen growth
we expect revenue to increase approximately three percent to four percent compared to the prior year
before i talk about our plans for the second half of fiscal twenty nineteen let me give you a high-level overview of our segment results during the quarter enrollments in our medical and healthcare segment were strong
and earnings per share from continuing operations before special items to grow in the two percent to three percent range compared to the prior year
during today's call we will refer to non-gaap financial measures which are intended to supplement though not substitute for our most directly comparable gaap measures
the growth trends in distance learning since our soft launch in march twenty eighteen are very positive and we're certain that this trend will continue based on our ability to deliver high-quality academic programs and experience to our students
we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be in the sixteen percent to seventeen percent range
as we think about not only the acams model but what are the other places in terms of certifications et cetera that we'd be able to use that model because we are recognized in the market
our press release which contains the financial and other quantitative information to be discussed today as well as a reconciliation of non-gaap to gaap measures is also available on our website
with regard to ross university school of medicine we opened the doors to its permanent home in barbados in january while it is still early we're already seeing encouraging trends and inquiries from prospective students now that rusm has a permanent home
the fourteen percent decrease was due to cost increases to support future growth and return to a normal level of expense at the medical schools
by using cutting-edge cellular science to develop personalized therapies for repairing tissue damage and disease orig three n recently reported a new round of financing
you never know when these things are going to come up we're obviously in the middle of our earnings season right now so we're spending a ton of time listening to companies report their earnings so i'd say the opportunity is around maybe not as plentiful but they're still there and like i said we've found two that
or over half the total value of the private portfolio not including hzo which historically was included in this list and was sold shortly after the quarter as kevin mentioned earlier
but not all of that money will accrue to the benefit of one eight oh shareholders just a portion of that and then the question is what do you want that fund to look like we do not actually -- we've come to the conclusion that we do not want to
they also reported last night and the numbers were solid the outlook was sound and they hired a new cfo we think the stock is grossly undervalued at this price and we're extremely excited about the stock at its current price
this quarter and also on this slide we are adding orig three n to this list of more mature private portfolio companies that we believe potentially can drive value in the future
please turn to slide twenty two as we have discussed in prior calls we have greatly reduced our operating expenses which will make it far easier to grow nav than in the past
we remain committed to treating every dollar of shareholder money with the utmost care and consideration it is much easier for us to grow nav when the expense hurdle rate is where it is today
i guess i lied we pulled it off again three quarters later and i'm really happy for our shareholders for the quarter that we've just had
so we've already brought in outside capital with the two spvs that we've done we obviously got a broker-dealer license which will enable us to compensate those that help us go out and raise outside funds
from the value that we had it on our balance sheet at march thirty one we told you we would work towards monetizing our private portfolio if the prices were right
we want one eight oh to be known as a prominent and dominant leader in our world of public company constructive activism we will continue to strive for excellence and investment performance
i give you an example for what we thought was going to occur in fourth quarter from customers they actually only spent about fifty eight percent of the total
so we've been working for several years to change that mix to a higher margin blend we made progress all the way through two thousand seventeen pricing across a lot of categories are improving
and feel good about all the other growth initiatives that we have funded but certainly i think 'eighteen is the best year we've had in the past three years for sure
i'm wondering what percentage of those international regions or product categories are ebit positive right now and do you think that segment turns profitable by year-end in terms of the ebit line
all the progress we made maintaining and acquiring new customers is paying off and we expect this to continue in two thousand eighteen as the market continues to improve
we are excited about e three and expect to hear major news on virtual reality as well as potential new consoles
but comping against the combination of battlefield hardline and mortal kombat was very tough as each of those titles sold one million units
tech brands' sales are expected to grow more than fifty percent in the second quarter the projected increase in operating earnings coming from tech brands and the margin from collectibles
as we've shared in investor day we expect to continue to keep pace with industry digital growth and expect full game downloads to eventually settle in at the twenty five percent to thirty percent range
but relative to other titles and other occasions that make sense for folks for example a big star wars theme around may four so we're seeing a growth
and with respect to inventory at the end of the quarter there were probably three things that happened we did see a healthy increase in our pre-owned inventory
you can see some pictures of that store in the supplemental deck we also have thirty four collectibles stores overseas
these events have traditionally been a catalyst for gme shares and mike hogan has done some modeling of potential impact that he will share with you in his remarks
this metric will be most meaningful at the end of our fiscal years keep in mind that we expect thirty percent or more of our fiscal two thousand sixteen operating earnings to come from sources other than physical gaming
as you can see on slide ten we continue to outpace physical software growth on the new platforms and are seeing less of a decline in pre-owned than we are in the previous-gen physical software
the recent case study published by forrester research might be of interest to you and it is available on our website their report summarizes the four takeaways we highlighted at our investor day
virtual reality and new consoles are a wildcard in that business segment and could dramatically change the growth projections and the fourth takeaway was that all of these combine to make gme a growing and diversified company
as we look at the months in the quarter we expect new software for the industry to grow in may with uncharted four doom
complex device it really becomes real to them and so we plan on literally having hundreds of stores that will have VR capability in fact that's what we've seen with the
as you can see in schedule one to the release we're now disclosing collectibles as its own sales and margin category it was previously included in other
we will update this information each quarter and later this year we will provide formal projections once we have more consumer data and initial sales data let's turn to page sixteen in the attached slide deck
and then secondly on VR it seems like it would be the case this is probably obvious that gamers would
please go it's in the first floor of our two-storey store there so there's a gamestop in the second store go downstairs it's a stunning store and you should go check it out i think it says a lot about
i think reiterated the twenty percent target and now a quarter later we're talking about fifteen percent so it seems like something changed there and i'm just trying to get a better handle on what that was
regardless of the market conditions as you know in q two the korean interest rate has been going on a downward trend
the sale of the keb building is being delayed so will you be able to sell the building within the year what's the plan with this
driving the overall downward trend in the delinquency ratio and now the provision on page eighteen as was mentioned
for the ldr but can you tell us about your target going forward with the change thank you very much
it's true that we are working very hard but for the nim outlook we believe that there won't be much change
regarding other government rate hikes and their impacts well it could be other factors that we are not able to actually account for now next question from nh investment
but it's another matter of whether all these positions will be filled with the right candidates even if we want to hire five hundred new employees
in june we signed thirteen new partners to participate in our token service provider program in all major regions
while this shift impacted our reported cross-border growth rates it has a minor effect on revenues since this is an intra-eu move the platform made to optimize the european business
also of note in -- the fourth quarter of fiscal year 'sixteen was the first time cross-border growth rates globally hit double digits in almost three years
i know you said seventy five percent to eighty percent is the goal for the end of the year but just looking for a mark for today
after three quarters here at visa i'm quite pleased with our business progress and our high level of execution
we expect that client migrations to the new systems will begin by the end of full year 'eighteen in moving our european clients to visanet we can provide enhanced network
period of time to get through over one hundred client contracts has just taken longer than we
to enable merchants to sign up and that is why we initially went with a qr code and now have worked closely with
we launched the visa ready program for business solutions this is a strategic framework and certification program to help technology companies that integrate with our b two b payment services to ensure that they meet standards and are market ready
expenses grew thirty one percent as expected expense growth ramped up from the first half levels as we stepped up technology as well as europe integration spending
i think we can get into all that when we talk about 'eighteen so it's a little too early to talk about all that right now i think all we were signaling was that there is going to be some shift in europe
points range by fiscal year 'twenty there's been a lot of moving pieces here i'm just looking for an update now on if those goals all stand
we continue to see pressure on margins caused by the increased cost of funding from basel iii requirements as well as increased levels of competition in the marketplace in the hunt for scarce quality assets
as is evidenced by the recent parliamentary hearings and in us maintaining our level two be status under the fse codes for eight consecutive years
are concentrated in ten clients we monitor these clients and the collateral held on an individual basis to ensure that solutions are applicable to each specific environment we then work closely
our strong capital position and ability to generate organic capital has supported our ability to increase dividend growth ahead of heps growth
the final phase is expected to be completed during the first half of two thousand eighteen and finally turning to prospects
together with continued investments this has depressed the roe to three percent well below the cost of equity
more agile and digital it platforms should both improve our product offerings and in so doing our customer experience but importantly at the same time deliver a more cost-efficient operating model
a large part of which we now drive with rigor in the rbb transformation office which we have established and i'll talk to this later
we continue to optimize our branch network through the closure of a net seventy two outlets in this period
and as we benefit from the recovery in eti and growth of our rest of african operations following the investments that we have made
zimbabwe is scheduled for october twenty seventeen these investments have positioned us favorably to support the growth in clients
thereby reducing the h one loss to be a smaller loss by the time we get to year-end
this should lead to continued improvements in the financial performance and efficiencies in rbb over the medium to long term
so while in the short-term our financial performance has come under pressure from both the economic environment in south africa and from the underperformance of eti we remain committed to our medium- to long-term targets
premise of the investment decision into eti took a view on our strategy for the rest of the continent
this is the -- when i joined the company sixteen months ago most of our supported -- our production was supported from a limited number of high-production wells within the tawke field
as you can see from the diagram on the right-hand side the production from the latest two wells on the northern flank are now amongst the most productive wells in the field with no water at all
as it is there are thirty well locations that have been identified to form part of that asset development plan
management of the free water level has also allowed the tt-twenty one well down to the south to come back on production
we are delighted to be working with chevron at sarta the asset has the potential to become one of the largest fields in kri and we look forward to starting the development journey and understanding the field potential
depending on the discussions with the krg discussions are active and progressing and as you may know the cps under the gas lifting agreement were recently extended to end of april
what we know for certain at the moment is that two wells have flowed at commercial rates with good quality oil and there are multiple reservoirs offering material potential
work rate point of view i think that's quite achievable the fact that we haven't drilled on the field extensively for the last two years does mean that production has declined and
it is also worth reiterating that we have now had three and a half years of continuous monthly payments from kurdistan regional government despite the many hardships they have faced in that time
there are a few areas in the world that can match the low-cost environment of the kri and provide such a material return on investments
so we have rather than sixteen months ago when we had all of our eggs in the tawke basket we now have a much more diverse source of cash flow and
production in much the same way as we've been doing again at peshkabir for the last eighteen months
additionally we saw a very good momentum in colorado and continued high growth in our destination markets which combined represented over seventy percent of our total unit growth
we also have some real estate that is no longer needed and hope to complete those sales in fiscal two thousand seventeen proceeds would be used to buy back stock finance growth or pay down debt
as one of the first results we found we could claim certain additional fico credits for prior years this amount was deducted from our income tax expense in the quarter otherwise we would have paid an effective tax rate of thirty six point six percent please
since our last call we have been getting ready to roll out our franchise marketing program our franchise has received legal approval in all fifty states
please turn to slide fourteen we also want to tell you about our new corporate headquarters
our plan is to move in by the end of fiscal two thousand and sixteen we have more than outgrown our existing facility which was built about twelve years ago
looking ahead we anticipate refinancing two commercial mortgages as part of a transaction
this new technology will automatically connect our accounting pos and banking systems
the stock is up more than thirty percent from our last call we believe that's a good indication that our strategy is working
with respect to this plan i would reiterate that we do not anticipate any significant updates to our two thousand and eighteen restructuring plan and we do not anticipate any additional plans or charges next year
a brand-new go-to-market process that has been really transformational for the company and we even really haven't even seen the benefit of that till beginning in spring two thousand and nineteen but you're starting to see some of that come together with just the timing
and when i think about 'nineteen and going forward i really look forward to the ability to explain to people and communicate them
revenue trajectory for twenty nineteen does that clearance base represent a hurdle you need to jump over
definitely a lot of energy coming from this business hovr also expanded into our sports style footwear category with the launch of slk which strikes the perfect balance between sport and street style
towards the end of this year and then also we've talked a lot about aggressively dealing with inventory we've done a lot of that in the first three quarters
and how do we make sure that where we're doing business it's really meaningful and impactful and that we can have the a-teams that are working on our product because footwear is one of those many things defined by the last ten percent or the last five percent and making sure that we finish there
a little more target and specific of what we've accomplished just in the last twenty months and i think it's important that people understand the seismic shift that we've been going through
we have also seen an increase in income tax when compared to the previous year due to a reduction in two thousand and fourteen from the impact of deferred taxes in spain after the decrease in the corporate tax rate
an increase in latam north in industrial risk and transportation due to the issuance of the pemex policy
and the top ten markets have generally lagged the broader economy in terms of revpar growth whereas the rest of the portfolio has
really to those two things we're at that part of the cycle where it's probably about peak supply i think we've seen some indicators that would suggest that
now going into twenty eighteen i think we're hopeful that the transaction pace will pick up and that the
is there any kind of as we look at twenty eighteen just a general sense for whether there's going to be more renovation activity or less relative
established an exchangeable bond based on the veon shares
i don't have a number on the arpu increase of that but all those packages would be
my comments on financial performance and the outlook for two thousand and seventeen will therefore be made on the basis of the current group structure excluding india
you have somewhat slower intake i'm just wondering whether there's a new balance to be struck now that the id sort of systems are in place or whether this is just a quarter with slightly slower growth and higher margin
before we move to questions and answers i just would like to take two minutes to clarify a bit because i read this morning that
and also our increased exposure to the strong sydney and melbourne markets we enter the second half with a record number of contracts on hand importantly over seventy percent of those are unconditional
so overall a reasonably challenging first six months for the business but we are seeing some green shoots and we are seeing the fundamentals of the business really give us confidence in the future growth of the sector
spend which will come in relating to future new launch projects i've got six new communities that we launch in the second half
we would expect more moderate price growth this year after a very strong price growth in twenty seventeen and in queensland we're seeing continual improvement
when you have a look at census data over the last ten years in fact the proportion of retirees living in a village continues to grow
you don't recover about half of that so that goes straight to the noi so that's part of it part of it is a marginal read-through of the rental deals that we've done
our progress in this respect is consistent with our intention four years ago to grow this segment and i'm very pleased with the progress
going to these markets through disciplined restocking they've been the two markets that have benefited the most
we currently have about five of our villages in the early stages of planning and we've started with holding units for sale at some of those villages
and the ongoing strong growth in over sixty five s for the retirement living business positions us to deliver sustainable growth
for the past five years we've been reshaping the business and really focusing on a clear three-point strategy
in residential and retirement living what you've seen is a significant increase in the last five years towards the strong sydney and melbourne markets
of those -- that amenity provision and importantly that community like many of the communities that we've commenced in the last five years is very close to new heavy rail
in relation to the retail town centres it's really three streams of work the first stream of work is where we develop
third is to grow the logistics and business park allocation to ideally well above twenty percent of our total assets
our performance was impacted by the anticipated factors which i discussed on the previous slide we continue to expect revenue growth for fiscal 'nineteen to be concentrated in the second half
additional information concerning risk factors and cautionary statements are available in our most recent sec filings and most recent prestige brands ten-k
in q two additional shipments will occur including to multiple top retail partners and the product will also begin to arrive on shelves
we are comprised of strong leading brands spanning various consumer health care categories as shown on the right side of slide nine over fifty percent of our sales are in five leading brands
in q one top line performance of the business was in line with our expectation
it's important to remember unless you knew exactly the monthly flow of sales you can't calculate dso and i think externally people just take the whole quarter without understanding the flow
and we continue to make progress on freight and warehousing costs experienced in fiscal 'eighteen we divested our household business which is positive to our financial profile
and we're avoiding a lot of those headwinds so we're not faced with the same situation that many others cpg companies are today and again we've talked about this a number of times in the past about
thanks phil and good morning everyone let's begin on page five we are pleased with our start to the year and results that were in line with the outlook we presented back in may
at the beginning of july we divested our household cleaning segment the transaction is accumulation of many strategic actions we've taken over the last seven years towards becoming a focused and leading consumer healthcare company
we may operate at peak levels closer to five and i'm not sure if four would be the right floor as well
our pacific northwest timber segment also reported higher harvest volumes as well as a seventeen percent lift in average delivered sawtimber pricing driven by continued strengthening of both domestic and export markets
could we see any sort of just moderation in four q pricing relative to three q just given conditions normalizing for some of the fire conditions out there
there you will also find our second quarter twenty seventeen earnings release at the end of this call the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours the replay of the call will be posted
financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the sec
we have marked some significant milestones since our last call in addition to renewing the net registry agreement with icann for another six years
earlier this month the company surpassed twenty continuous years of one hundred percent availability in the com and net dns this record is the result of the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure
second quarter of twenty sixteen like the investment community does we too compare our results to the baltic index
our board our management team and our financial and legal advisers spent a great deal of time analyzing the proposal and had multiple meetings with bw before their proposal was withdrawn
it is worth pointing out that our voyages are generally forty to sixty days in duration and are fixed two to four weeks in advance
for this reason we cofounded and operate the helios lpg pool which now includes twenty nine ships we have and will continue to explore growth opportunities
we continue to benefit from our aggressive hedging policy and the favorable pricing of our japanese financings leaving us with a current interest cost fixed hedge in a small floating piece of roughly four point four percent in
will pay a surcharge in order to get an api and it will really depend upon a range of circumstances in terms of the amount of data that they will be using and all kinds of things but
rising trailing twelve-month renewal rate and based upon the strength of our every comp everywhere campaign that we launched last fall
the increase in the margins is really going to come from the fact that this is more of a fixed cost structure where we currently are for the remainder of two thousand and seventeen and
certain clients that want to just write a check and put the case behind them and don't necessarily feel at this time a subscription is so it is a little bit more difficult to know in any ninety-day period
we believe the api together with the granular building level database that i have been spending a lot of time on
in two thousand and sixteen expenses rose incrementally due to the expansion of our sales force management hires and operations in the latter half of the year and the now normalized level of rent expense
i expect that the aggregate expenses that we are reporting in the first quarter of two thousand and seventeen will generally stay at this level for the remainder of the year
all of the new forerunners are compatible with our connect iq application framework enabling users to personalize their watches with a host of interesting watch faces custom data fields and useful applications developed by third parties
europe and international is probably a year or two behind in terms of the overall adoption of
and as more technology kind of gets baked into cars at the oem level it would seem to create an opportunity for aftermarket sales
certain statements made during the call today constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to and within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of nineteen ninety five as amended
our two thousand eighteen strategic initiatives are designed to specifically address each of these core issues increase the level of service to our customers and improve our financial results
but we now believe the increased promotions instead of increasing traffic were having the opposite effect on our business over the last four quarters
included the addition of many new stone and accessory skus now we are working through the process of introducing an additional one thousand new skus over the next six months
third we are focusing our capital investment over the next twelve months on remodeling approximately thirty stores to support our product presentation strategy
adjusts our gaap quarterly results by eliminating special charges and then applies the tax rate to the result
on average the payback that we get on that remodel is less than two years it's often better than opening a new store in terms of the return on that investment so we think it's a good return for sure
i remained on the board and was serving in that capacity through most of this year during the third and fourth quarters of twenty seventeen the board and management initiated a comprehensive review of our business strategy
to have a direct and meaningful impact on the performance of the roughly thirteen stores that each of them oversee
i'd like to highlight a few of the investments we're making over the next twelve months to support each of our key strategies
as we veered away from the five critical success factors which have historically driven our success over the past two decades
in twenty sixteen he became our first director of talent development and was responsible for creating and implementing a comprehensive new sales associate and store manager training program throughout the company
while our focus will be on remodeling stores in twenty eighteen rather than opening new stores we continue to believe we have a significant opportunity for unit growth
i think the best way to explain my role is to say that it is unlikely that i will be speaking to you as ceo a year from now
with hindsight we now believe the increase promotional cadence over the last four quarters leading up to the black friday holiday weekend likely alienated many of our pro customers
while it's not my intent to remain as CEO i can also say that my personal commitment to this company is strong and i intend to leave the company in good hands
we believe this transaction positions biogen to be at the forefront of alzheimer's research in terms of both mechanisms of action and time to market
now on to spinraza the initial underlying demand has been robust we noticed a solid progress in terms of both infrastructure and insurance coverage
we are preparing for potential eu markets approval in the coming months we are also getting ready for potential approvals in japan and canada this year
as we go forward we'll be closely watching the launch of ocrevus overall we anticipate a negative impact to our portfolio that'll be partially offset by the royalties that we receive
i am especially pleased to welcome you to this call as the ceo of biogen before i turn to the details of the quarter i would like to share some initial thoughts on how biogen is positioned today and where we see the company progressing
second we are very pleased with the favorable outcome of the ipr proceeding
importantly data also showed patients who continue tysabri treatment experienced better clinical outcomes than those who switched to another therapy
we are planning to initiate another phase ii study in small fiber neuropathy towards the end of this year as we continue to explore multiple potential indications for this asset
as you will see throughout the rest of the call i think we are already off to a great start q one was a very good quarter financially and also a quarter with exciting events
but before i turn it over to mike let me provide you with more details on our commercial performance starting with ms
these numbers have been increasing every week some leading centers are already dosing more than ten patients
we believe the spinraza experience provides a glimpse of the future for targeting severe neurological disease and we aim to capitalize on this changing paradigm
importantly as we look to expand our presence in sma we are also excited about the potential for gene therapy as a complementary mechanism
the experience with spinraza highlights to us the real potential advantage of intrathecal asos as a modality we've got an early
for new gcu to enter into a shared services agreement with the company
while an application for approval of the proposed sale has been submitted to hlc along with draft documents that if the application is approved would govern the terms of the sale and the shared services arrangement
in addition we continue to see an increase in occupancy cost including depreciation and amortization as a result of us placing into service additional buildings especially laboratory-intensive stem buildings
the previous three or four years and we are staying very consistent with what we're saying we're going to be able to do the next three or four years and so
and then the third bucket would be the bonuses and any other expenses that you would expect to not recur beyond two thousand and eighteen yes
we expect our online campus to grow between six percent and seven percent on an annual basis
definitive agreements between the company and new gcu have not been signed and key terms remain subject to analysis
our guidance assumes a slight increase in retention and an increase in graduates between years of approximately thirteen percent the significant retention gains we have seen in recent years and the continued shift to a higher percentage of graduate students
for total programs at the end of twenty eighteen so in other words how many new programs are expected to launch this next year
just in regards to the twenty new programs for this next year what is the mix between graduate versus stem programs
it would be difficult for us to believe it would be the last two because the thing is so similar to what is going on
well currently we have two boards the university has a board of trustees that's responsible for overseeing the academic
the revenue share between the two entities remains subject to completion of a transfer pricing study and subsequent negotiation
the company does not expect to execute any definitive agreements until the hlc process has concluded
that our proposed transaction and structure is almost identical to many others in the industry and is very similar to the purdue-kaplan proposal which hlc is also reviewing at this time
this increase was partially offset byless day of traditional campus revenue in the fourth quarter as compared to two thousand and sixteen due to a shift in the timing of a residential traditional campus start date
in the first part of the twenty fifteen numbers we would expect to see that in the first part of the twenty sixteen numbers we then have a second effect
decent price performance in the first part of the year but in the middle of the year where in prior years we had had some decent success on pricing we did not have as much success in twenty fifteen as a result
manufacturing strategy so we never believed when we saw the huge buildup of capacity in china during the two thousands that there was enough factor cost advantage or
we are pleased with the progress that we have demonstrated in the composites business over the past two years including improvements in operating margins and return on capital
in 'fifteen and got margins back to kind of that mid-teens level which is where we've historically guided the business as a matter of fact
over the course of the last three or four years when an industry is going through a very challenged time
that both gave you some cost absorption actually the growth could contribute some amount of earnings and then we started to see some pricing that also helped us sustain fifty percent operating leverage over the last couple of years we are now kind of entering a stage where our assets are a bit better utilized
we're carrying a bit less price into twenty sixteen we do have a price action in the market today that we've talked about previously on a prior earnings call i think we feel pretty good about our ability to realize price in the early part of this year
labor growth and if you look at some of the trades that would be important to insulation demand you didn't see much labor growth in framing contracting in the second half of two thousand and fifteen which would suggest
with that let me now turn to twenty sixteen in insulation we expect revenue growth will be slightly weaker than the growth experienced in twenty fifteen while we do expect margin expansion
with that review of key financial highlights i ask you to turn to slide eight where we provide a more detailed review of our business results beginning with our insulation business
this represents fourteen percent operating margins and our eighteenth consecutive quarter of ebit improvement operating leverage exceeded expectations in the quarter on strong manufacturing productivity
that we did not extend by mutual agreement at the end of two thousand and fifteen second
and we are confident that these businesses will grow earnings in two thousand and sixteen now i'll ask you to turn your attention to slide nine for a review of our composites business
and went through some of the relationships that we see between oil and asphalt cost and then also how long it takes the oil cost to come through our economics about ninety days to get through the refinery about ninety days to get through our cost of goods
we expect this capacity to be available in twenty seventeen and help us meet the needs of our customers in a growing market
the financial results we have delivered are roughly one year ahead of schedule
as a result of that i think we said a number of times last year we didn't really see much deflation in twenty fifteen until really the middle of the second quarter so we have one benefit in twenty sixteen which was we'd expect to see
was relatively close to zero so anytime you saw any growth at all and you could load hot assets you could get
and we think we're returning back to an industry that looks more similar to what we would have seen in the eighties and the nineties than what
but in addition to strong ebit growth in all three of our businesses and strong earnings growth as michael noted we also had very strong free cash flow which has been
if i could draw your attention to the safe harbor statement on slide two of the presentation i'd like to remind participants on this morning's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking statements about monro's future performance
through these efforts we have taken major steps to improve our customers' in-store experience and help ensure that we deliver a five star experience to them every time at every one of our store locations
the third quarter had eighty nine selling days compared to ninety in the prior year period
i think if you look at the way kind of the quarter set up we were up about seven in october up about seven in november down six adjusted for days in december
we are pleased to announce that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire twelve stores in louisiana expanding our store footprint in a new market and building out our geographical presence in the south
we expect to refresh the appearance of approximately seventy stores in our southern markets in the first quarter
we are also very encouraged to see the upgrade to a mobile capable architecture has led to an eighty percent increase in mobile phone conversion rates
the most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in monro's filings with the sec and in our earnings release
as a reminder our monroforward initiatives unveiled in may of last year are built around four areas of focus in order to increase the overall lifetime value of our customers and create a scalable platform for sustainable growth
of fiscal twenty twenty as previously discussed we are determining the appropriate scope of refresh needed for each of our stores by examining their age size
we believe that these positive top line trends are a testament to our relentless focus on driving operational excellence and delivering a consistent five star experience to our customers
at a much lower price per puff is a major opportunity for vip six new products have been identified
and start working with them to be much more proactive in converting those over to vip shops
of what you think the business climate might be in the next four years and if you think it'd be helpful for ecig on
jeff with respect to what the ideal partner would be there's probably seven or eight criteria there we pulled that together
she has only been on board for about two weeks and her impact has obviously not yet been seen she is very experienced and we feel that our licensees who have been not really monitored
the reason i felt that it was important to mention is that we spent the first seven months of the fiscal trying to make global e-commerce profitable and investing very heavily in the division
we plan to be completed by march twenty seventeen the big value of that is a lot of our decisions are made without a lot of data and not up-to-date data
a new erp system is being installed to record the success and provide data to develop and to react a new compensation plan is built
in one huge country big smoking country we have two companies both tobacco companies one a large tobacco company one a very small tobacco company in the country that would like us to
in iraq signs of increased activity are emerging in the north with at least one major ioc expected to resume activity during the first quarter
the total reactivation cost of the fleet to be as well and whether you expect all twenty of these fleets to be working by the culmination of the end of this year
in land development drilling work for both pemex and a number of local operators due to the absence
in the south of the country we have made further market share gains with additional awards of ids contracts
a business we started over twelve months ago focused on providing an integrated completion and fracturing offering in the unconventional market
all of this means that after four years of waiting the oil market is now substantially rebalanced this is also reflected in the oil market sentiment where we currently are witnessing a gradual shift from an oversupply discount
so thank you for that final question i would now like to summarize the three most important points we have discussed this morning
although these were partially offset by stronger sis software sales and increased product sales from the drilling and production groups
we are confident these positive trends will continue going forward for the last twenty years we have demonstrated a consistent ability
so clearly the market has changed the ratio requirement has changed but in those two buildings we can accommodate
our management team has recently assessed the viability of development and validate there is potential to build well in excess of ten thousand net new apartments
and i think some of you have actually heard me say before that the default rate for the capreit portfolio now is actually lower than the cmhc mortgage default rate it's
the clinical and commercial investments that we've made over the last nine months have positioned us well to accelerate organic growth in the second half of the year
the first risk was the sales force in the css segment and the integration and our significant
during the second quarter we advanced our commercialization plans for a number of products and just last week we launched the cusa clarity platform in japan
total css international sales were flat in the second quarter compared to the prior year
because of a tough comparison resulting from a large order that occurred in the second quarter of two thousand seventeen this result was consistent with the expectations that we had mentioned on our first quarter earnings call
i'm not that concerned about the switzerland plant conversion from sap to oracle we've done that multiple times that happens in the fourth quarter
the consumable growth is an indicator of the success that we're seeing with the adoption of cusa clarity and disposable sales are a good measure of capital utilization
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the sec and in the release
during the second quarter we completed the expansion of our ott commercial channel
we had many success stories during the quarter one bright spot was the performance of our acute wound reconstruction business the channel investments we made over the last nine months increased the capacity of our reps
a bit later in the call i will highlight some of the scientific progress we made in further developing our c one gene expression platform
we and others in the industry believe that we will be successful in developing our c one cell line into a next-generation protein expression and production system
thank you two thousand eighteen has truly been a transformational year for dyadic looking ahead we are very confident in our ability to generate meaningful scientific results
we continue to gain momentum and awareness within the pharma and biotech industry regarding the potential for our c one gene expression platform to potentially disrupt the status quo and helping to speed up the development
we began to develop a c one downstream purification process for certolizumab we demonstrated further success in reaching high and promising expression levels
this information can be found in our other filings with the sec when available
in the first quarter of twenty nineteen in addition we are in various stages of negotiations
if you'd like to see more information about this i suggest you review the slide deck on the zapi project on the company's website under our media center on the presentations tab
so we just say stay tuned but yes we expect more deals to be done and we expect at least one or two maybe more even in q two to be announced
now we don't expect to sustain the nim at this level going forward and in fact largely due to purchase accounting we'll continue to experience some ongoing nim pressure although at a declining rate compared to last year
as we refined the calculation of the value of the dta while the transaction took longer to close than we initially estimated we're very pleased with the economics which are slightly more favorable than what we originally announced
the bottom line is that we believe we're well positioned for rising rates the chart in the upper left summarizes our exposure to four scenarios this year
having said that we think there's probably a secular decline going on with regard to nsf fees
so we're continuing to work on additional cost savings projects to close the gap to one one oh these additional projects will likely include actions to rationalize excess facilities
the current consensus is pretty close to the seventy five basis point scenario and if it takes place as expected
we have a relatively high tax rate compared to peers largely due to the fact that we don't have much in the way of boli or munis as a result any reductions in corporate tax rate should flow straight to our bottom line
and this should be particularly noticeable in the first quarter as that nine basis point recovery we had this quarter will be gone
because i don't have all that data and i'm working off recall here but nonetheless march was the best month in sixteen months if you look at the daily trends the macros in march and compare that to april
but that does not include the countless hours spent by both hwc and vertex management and personnel in executing the integration plan
i'll then turn the call over to nic who will discuss our financial performance in additional detail even though it's been just a little over one and a half months since we last reported
for projects for us is the industrial space the two biggest components of that are the combination of upstream and midstream and then downstream and the total spend
for details of the fourth quarter and twenty fifteen i'm going to hand the microphone over to my partner
during tonight's call we may use a non-gaap financial measure if we believe it is useful to investors
but i think my comment earlier really related to a declining rate of order growth that we saw through the back end of the year and into q four and i would say that
before we begin i'd like to refer you to the first two slides of our presentation
the next major investment the first tranche of that really starts to impact our results in twenty eighteen and certainly the driver
in addition we have included non-gaap financial information in our discussion reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures are included in the earnings release and in the appendix of the presentation
our trentwood facility continues to increase efficiency and throughput from investments in the phase five expansion and the new casting complex
and with additional investments in quality efficiency and production capacity we will continue to capitalize on these opportunities to deliver improved value-added revenue and ebitda we will now open the call for questions
that over the next several years we're going to see a five percent compound annual growth rate in our content per vehicle
as a business i mean we -- i characterize it internally here we think we're doing pretty well but we're like the best hockey players in mexico and we want to get to the nhl here in terms of our cost management
we have also posted a pdf version of the slide presentation for this call
any reference in our discussion today to ebitda means adjusted ebitda which excludes non-run-rate items for which we've provided reconciliations in the appendix
underlying manufacturing efficiencies continued to improve in the quarter as our ebitda margin improved
but again a good place to look i think people -- if you go back and look -- and we put ten years' worth of information in our investor presentation
relatively low the second quarter we think it's going to be strong in the second half of the year it's back more to -- you need to look at it in six-month buckets there are just too many things that
in terms of the -- quantifying what might the risk be it's really a function of two variables here the first variable is how steeply does that go up
this wasn't the case in our fiscal twenty sixteen as the back half slowed due to the industrial sector slowdown but it's more along the lines of what we had expected on a normal year
now let's talk about the specifics of our first quarter fiscal 'seventeen our sales were down a bit versus a year ago however if we parse the numbers you can actually get a clear picture of why our results are better than they appear on the surface
legacy fluorescent and services revenue accounted for the majority of the remaining revenue and declined by thirty nine percent in the first quarter when compared to the year-ago period
specifically the growth in led products is expected to overtake the decline in legacy products and services and drive the growth of our consolidated revenue for the remainder of this fiscal year
it also supports our growth expectations for twenty seventeen in addition to the pace of bookings we measure field of service requests
our new agency partners have the potential to deliver revenue that is an order of magnitude bigger than what we were doing with just our esco customers
continuing with our revenue commentary it is also informative to understand that we have intentionally redirected the smallest esco partners
effectively this means we were able to redirect a large number of small esco partners to distribution
in order to accomplish that we will need to continue to see growth from high-margin led products and maintain strong margins on our other product lines and service lines
a small increase in other income and a tax benefit were enough to reduce our net loss in the first quarter of fiscal two thousand seventeen versus a comparable year-ago period
at this time i would like to say a word about our guidance for fiscal two thousand and seventeen as we previously mentioned we are revising our expectations for two primary reasons
a very successful sector in the market for us over the last two decades and we continue to see that as a competitive advantage going forward so some of what we're doing right now is just keeping up technology revs
bill will then discuss the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal twenty seventeen and subsequently open the call to questions from the audience
these new agents are off to a good start but they haven't quite made up all of the foregone revenue from small esco partners that we redirected towards distribution
to give you some perspective our previous channel addressed about thirteen percent of the industrial and commercial lighting market
to distribution and consolidated around our most successful escos essentially we've gone from over one hundred esco partners at the beginning of this year to about a dozen today that represent most of the volume
validates our assertion that we're well ahead of the industry in terms of transitioning to led lighting
in our channel pivot in early twenty sixteen and for this reason we've taken a more conservative stance with regards to how quickly our new agent partners will ramp up
we have reached the point where led product represents our core business as they have become the focus of almost all of our customers
the impact of redirecting a large number of small esco partners was felt on the revenue line but should be more than made up by new agency partners over time
in q one and q two we've installed twenty eight screens in absolute top locations and implemented a smart mixture of local content news and sports as well as advertising on the screens
and that's why we try to develop our transaction business in line with our four publishing verticals of news and services tech and games entertainment as well as women and lifestyle
it's still early days but we see huge potential to further combine the two repositioning cases which massively benefit from each other
what our sales forces do they go to small midsize clients and go for instance to a bakery and sell the two or three billboards around the bakery
do social traffic management for that we do it on a monthly basis so as soon as we sell the product in itself we have recurring revenues of let's say two to three years that's why the order book
in the second quarter from the good start two thousand and sixteen one of the key reasons
but they don't sell it like to national campaigns for a campaign for two or three weeks
for an online shop for electronics products we already put together an assortment range of over two thousand items
of maximum transparency on the acquired companies from day one we call it accountability concept
they sell it as a signage business for three years so what you actually do with the sales force you go there have once the sales effort but then you have almost like a three-year subscription
at lower cost we have already created more than six hundred pieces of video content it's currently an output of twenty piece per day and will get beyond forty on a daily basis by the end of the year
but we see from a pure revenue perspective that we grow by more than seventy percent and we see for the first time in the last two quarters that ecpms are improving
the final settlement agreement will be subject to approval by the puct we currently anticipate that the commission will consider the proposed settlement in the second quarter
in addition plans were unveiled for a four-acre resort to be located within the westside development called montecillo a marriott brand hotel and resort would be located near a top golf facility that is already under construction nearby
there are about fifteen hundred customers subscribed to the solar output and almost four hundred customers on the waiting list which demonstrates our community's commitment to solar power
we expect the implementation of new rates following our twenty seventeen texas rate case will help reduce the impact of regulatory lag so now i'd like to take a moment to review our twenty seventeen texas rate case filing on the next slide
on march fourteen the administrative law judges in our case issued an order adopting a procedural schedule as the schedule indicates we're currently immersed in the discovery process and we've been busy responding to numerous requests for information
turning to slide eight i cannot remember a time in which so many large-scale development projects have been announced in our region in such a short period
except as may be required by law during the call we will also present some financial information on a non-gaap basis
as we approach the end of twenty eighteen we are seeing momentum all around the world we are executing on a robust pipeline of targeted opportunities across academic translational research cros and cancer centers
non-gaap information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of the company's operating results
this region has been a soft spot for us over the past two years however i'm pleased that we are building on the momentum we established last quarter delivering sequential growth for the first time since i arrived two years ago
these are just two examples out of many demonstrating how our technologies are leading the way to new insights within tissue
we expect total cash outflow in the first quarter of two thousand and nineteen to be higher than our projected outflow for the fourth quarter driven by bonus payments and our semi-annual interest payment on convertible debt
at the close of the market today fluidigm released its financial results for the quarter ended september thirty twenty eighteen i'd also like to let everyone know that our outdated investor presentation
our us team has massively improved our financial performance in this region we've hit key milestones for instrument placements with strong uptake of the hyperion imaging system
as has been our norm i'd like to begin with an overview of our financial results for the quarter and then discuss markets and strategy then i'll turn the call over to vikram jog our cfo for a more detailed financial review before offering closing remarks and taking questions
our technology was included in the key publications this quarter for a foundational ten thousand immunome project and a seminal research published in the new england journal of medicine
of company to watch in twenty nineteen we will find out the results next week we have really come a long way in the last two years
specifically we received a chmp positive opinion
has many limitations as physicians must choose between invasive iv delivery or slower onset oral medications
will provide us a better platform on which zalviso can more easily follow after health care professionals are educated on and experienced with
of historical us institutional sales teams they number around sixty give or take a little bit more or less that's likely a number we would work to put in a stepwise fashion
yes that's a great question and it would be on the former of that you mentioned we believe that we're a hospital company that today's platform is built off of our sublingual sufentanil tablets it just so happens we've got two products built off of that fundamental
the outcome of the study leads us to believe that we have also satisfied the second point in the crl so with the crl points addressed
as we continue to hold on ramping up commercial resources prior to a potential pdufa date for dsuvia we will continue to manage our cash prudently with the goal of ensuring we have adequate financial resources
last year due to lower zalviso shipments to grunenthal as they continue to work down the inventories purchased
that's it we have a tight marketing team and outside of commercial we just have a very light msl team consisting of one with a couple of consultants so we continue to remain very tight
we would expect a final decision as to approval for our dzuveo marketing authorization by early third quarter of this year
we'll highlight aspects of our rems program and the distribution restricted to those that would qualify for receiving our product and those would likely be the main focus moving forward
so if you look at the revision we made to our guidance we lowered our full year estimate of production by one point one million barrels of oil equivalent and all of that is essentially from expected lower gas and ngl production from our eagle ford asset
and we don't do it in just one location we'll probably do it in four before we'll draw a conclusion
that people need to understand how the numbers add up now certain analysts were -- have numbers in their guidance for four q that are well above ours and i never really understand how they -- how people get so far off our guidance but
that we were looking basically at different licensing agreement that were mostly related to two areas one is the game features
the numbered -- the numbers we offered a few weeks ago remain unchanged q one results were within a normal range of variation on both the top and bottom lines a good start to the year and we see no reason for a change to our published guidance
another large project that we can now discuss is the new york city housing authority or nycha on april six nycha announced the commencement of work of the -- on the first phase of their energy performance contract
this first phase will also provide employment opportunities for nycha residents as well as local businesses
in fact this was the best annual adjusted credit segment operating income conn's has produced in five years
typically occur in the fourth quarter which happened this year and drove a ten basis point reduction in our net yield compared to the third quarter rate
so to conclude my prepared remarks before i turn the call over to lee fourth quarter and fiscal year two thousand and nineteen results demonstrate the strength of our financial model and the positive evolution of our business
we typically start incurring costs associated with new stores approximately six months ahead of opening and there will be additional expenses incurred throughout the fiscal year as we prepare to open these locations
references to balances and percentages of accounts receivable sixty days plus past due were re-aged on today's conference call and going forward will be at carrying value
for fiscal year twenty twenty we plan to open twelve to fifteen new stores in existing states which will all be in our new store layout featuring an enhanced customer experience and a more efficient sales process
growth of eight percent to ten percent and we believe we are well positioned to achieve this goal in fiscal year twenty twenty with this let me turn the call over to lee
thank you i just want to take a moment first of all and always take the time to thank our almost five thousand associates across the company for the job they do each and every day our record
please refer to the company's earnings release that was issued today for a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to their most comparable gaap measures
as we mentioned in our third quarter conference call strong november sales benefited from higher promotional activity in the large-screen tv category
to make it easier for investors to understand our customer accounts receivable and associated credit performance we are now presenting certain credit measures primarily those in note two of our ten-k on a carrying value basis
in addition to our focus on working capital management through lean initiatives our capex was significantly reduced with our capacity expansion phase virtually completed in twenty sixteen as a result
banking services revenue was up more than six percent due to higher seasonal electronic banking transaction volumes
momentum with promesa or the budget comes out and looks like things are going to be stable would there be any possibility for some capital actions this year how do you guys think about that
please turn to slide five from a business point of view
which are subject to various risks and uncertainties outlined in the risk factors section of ofg's securities and exchange commission filings
on slide ten you can see the credit performance continues to hold steady considering the prevailing market conditions
we believe that we are progressing that plan with msha and hope to gain plan approval by mid-november
at the present time we are continuing to work with msha to develop a plan that will allow for extraction of the longwall equipment from the current panel
what you think is a reasonable expectation or target in these markets going forward i hate -- i don't mean to pin you to an exact number but just generally speaking what do you think is doable in terms of reducing the leverage ratio over let's say the next twelve to eighteen months
to really say definitively what kind of realizations you're going to 'sixteen and 'seventeen we have our contract book
players in the industry what we can tell you is our capacity when we can get up to twenty eight million tons does not require us to invest additional capex so it's a production decision not an investment decision
turning to slide four on the second topic of growth and investment i want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments
reflecting our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in twenty sixteen results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements
this was primarily driven by unfavorable timing of certain tax-related items that we expect to normalize by q two partially offset by working capital improvements and a decline in cash paid for pensions and restructuring
we will continue to grow even after the sale of the segment yes and one of the things i would observe that you saw in q one two thousand and sixteen as greg described is we had an unusually strong comparable
and by the way you see that in risk solutions and you see that in hr solutions both so these investments we've been making over time
there are areas that are outside that as we continue to evolve and develop by the way that's in hr solutions
look at new business in q one it was a record in us retail it was a record worldwide by the way that's a record on top of a record it was
the piece of the business in that segment had a seven percent i guess negative
thank you for taking the time to listen in on our fiscal twenty seventeen results conference call
i'll now turn the call over to richard to review our fiscal twenty seventeen financial highlights in greater details
we completed the private placement on december twenty seven for more details on the terms of the draw-down facility please see our news release
walmart spent five months testing our batteries at room temperature and also in cold warehouses
fortune five hundred companies are not going to commit to orders until they have tested our products exhaustively and are convinced that will make a tangible difference to their business
this transaction is expected to close on or around february twenty eight but is subject to usual closing conditions
we began an intensive product development period before launching our initial forklift batteries in fiscal twenty seventeen we then had to be patient
both for the oem market as well as for the final battery product for the forklift and the materials handling market
perspective and then some of the engagements you have with oems are there -- you're taking class one to class three is it more concentrated in class three just trying to get a sense of the mix within the
the third and largest cost of goods sold will take the longest to recognized -- to be recognized and will mostly be realized by year three our current structure systems and processes are fragmented and cause confusion between us and our supply of partners
at the end of our fourth quarter we expect to be in a better position to provide expectations of the rate of realization of benefits over the next two years and the impact on our ebitda margins
we're on pace to do that we haven't said they're going to be in bc we haven't said where they're going to be in the west
on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal twenty twenty the transition of our merchandising staff will occur over the next six months
as a good partner they were with us in the last i would say sixty years so there's no reason that it won't work for e-commerce it's where we are now
during the first quarter of two thousand nineteen from which we expect to gain insights that will assist us in our evaluation of the effects of sotatercept as a potential first in class disease-modifying treatment
so we would look at the current sort of comparative therapies and the other mds drugs that are out there
as a reminder ace-oh eighty three is designed to increase strength and function in specific target muscles the data presented were consistent with the findings we reported at neurology congresses throughout this year
in pah along with preclinical presentations and an overview of our clinical development efforts
negative to limited efficacy results in dmd and so that might be a case where you want to do something with a gene therapy first
as a reminder all accepted ash abstracts will be announced and available online this coming thursday
the mean duration of therapy for those who were responders was approximately nineteen months
the inclusion criteria of command and those are patients with epo levels
blast cell count type increases and everything in the phase two has already been reported
and so second half of next year as far as timing goes is going to be a really important readout for ace-oh eighty three and then as far as we'll wait and see based off of those data if we decide to expand
our other markets combined saw shipment growth of over six percent this is much more in line with expectation and trend
we have secured the total of eight million tons of shipments it's just a matter of when they ship florida continues to be good both on the public side
so it's not just that we're getting it wrong or it's not happening as quickly as we thought it was going to happen it's not happening like the dot thought it was going to happen or the general contractor thought it was going to happen it's just
which are subject to risks and uncertainties these risks are described in detail in the company's sec reports including our earnings release and our most recent annual report on form ten-k
rain fifteen days out of a month or fourteen days out of a month and is spread out
the tennessee dot is trying to accelerate that spending but it always takes a little time
you can find a reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation
in addition our visibility to a turn in public construction activity continued to improve there are more highway project tons in backlog than we've seen in at least three years
could you give us a sense in terms of breaking out the state growth just as you did for texas but focusing on the la market versus northern and the san diego market in terms of what is driving real demand in the market
so i think if you did second half it's probably equivalent to something like four percent to eight percent just keeping in mind that july was
look we pay a lot of attention to the mla we understand sort of the implications of what can and can't be offered and we sort of probably made those modifications about a year ago
i would like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in stratus' press release issued today and to the risk factors described in stratus' form ten-k and subsequent sec filings
we have successfully expanded to other attractive growth markets as a method of diversifying our portfolio and ensuring that we can continue to develop projects such as our multiple heb-anchored mixed-use properties
we intend to explore opportunities to sell this property in twenty nineteen subject to leasing progress and market conditions
our core expenses for the quarter were up less than two percent which is primarily a function of variable expenses on core revenue growth
it's also worth noting that it is only seventeen percent of our free cash flow and that percentage will likely decline here as we go into successive quarters so
january was the weakest month of the quarter political revenues were under one percent of our quarterly sales
other than to note that we've been very consistent in noting that there are three fundamental criteria with which we look at any potential expansion which would be does it strategically fit
for example since the start of the year we have added a number of new air personalities most notably a star in atlanta and have successfully re-branded two of our stations in miami and san diego
in areas where they have a market in fiber for the last two years our penetration rate is nearly fifty percent that's quite a bit higher than in our nonfiber markets and leaves us a lot of room to run over the next couple of years
both sides are wrapping up their cases and are now preparing for closing arguments on april thirty after that we'll wait for the court's ruling
and we expect to reach more than five hundred markets by the end of the year
these sixteen million locations and the more than one million route miles of fiber in our overall network
they're very active they've already gotten a number of contracts done in over forty states
we don't expect video to be any different we do expect revenue and margin pressure as we manage through this especially this year but we're excited about directv now's product improvements and our new user interface
we've also started the heavy lifting of putting band fourteen on our towers
we can provide firstnet quality services on our existing lte network
and we continue to be very excited about it we will get a significant amount of the band fourteen up this year
over the next five years we'll be putting band fourteen on tens of thousands of new and existing sites nationwide
particularly as we've gotten through the legacy DSL conversions which has really been absorbing us for the last few years
and so it impacted service ebitda margins
as well as the new spectrum band fourteen gives us real excited about the ability to serve customers really really well
looking at total video subs we actually have more subscribers today than we did two years ago because of the success of directv now
subscriber growth continues to be strong in mexico we added more than five hundred thousand new subscribers in the quarter
moving to the dtv now platform or moving to a thin client platform eventually for the home is really going to change the free cash flow aspects because the upfront
business acumen and strategic expertise have helped cable one evolved into a leading broadband communications provider
but i don't see us having an issue with hanging in the two percent range
a strategy which we believe is serving both cable one customers and our shareholders well
total company residential hsd arpu growth has been fueled by a proportional mix of marketing such as lack of discounts and improved sell-in and upgrades
the migration of northeast division customers to legacy cable one's more robust billing system will provide a more consistent customer-centric experience
the second quarter also saw the deployment of hosted voice service across nearly forty percent of our markets
he has been a key contributor to the development and execution of the company's strategic plan and has played a strong financial foundation for cable one to continue its focus on driving growth that is profitable and sustainable
we still continue to expect that our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues will be in the high teens for two thousand and eighteen from a liquidity standpoint
we also continued to experience steady and strong adjusted ebitda growth and margin expansion
thank you operator i just want to thank julie and the entire cable one team for all their support
offering business customers to freedom and flexibility of the latest cloud-based virtual pbx technology
interesting to note that when we reduce prices on faster tiers arpu actually goes up because selling goes up and our already low churn is going lower
this upgraded service covers up to ten thousand square feet when deployed with the latest wi-fi technology installed by cable one business
thank you kevin we are sincerely grateful for all that you've done since joining the cable one family
with our longstanding track record it should come as no surprise that we are prepared and excited about twenty eighteen we pride ourselves on leaving little to change
we're well positioned with multiple brands and levers and have confidence that we will be able to continue to drive results in twenty eighteen and beyond as nutrisystem continues to grow
four investing in the business to support future growth we have a total of seven warehouses across the continental united states over the last two years we've doubled our frozen warehouses from two to four as demand for our frozen products has increased
intel notes that over fifty percent of the people who want to lose weight are looking for food that has low sugar
over the past few weeks i have participated in introductory meetings with two fortune fifty prospect companies in each of these meetings we were meeting with c-level executives who were hearing our story for the first time
our fifth consecutive quarter of revenue and adjusted ebitda organic growth
to provide supplier communications and support services using prgx's lavante supplier information management technology platform
we are having those type of discussions and i think there's just -- as i described earlier there's a little bit of a lag there's typically a lag with respect to net additions and the returns that we've delivered over the past twelve months
partially offset by a seven basis points decrease in the average base management fee percentage
as one measure of the strength of our business we monitor what we call base ebitda base ebitda eliminates the financial impact of performance fees as well as certain expenses such as stock option and retirement obligation expenses
the consistency of the performance we are delivering and the momentum we have in all four measures of our progress
and we've delivered four consecutive years of strong free cash flow performance which we've sustained in the first half
operating margins were higher than expected at the time of the agm trading statement
we've made good progress in each of the five work streams and you can see it in our results
i shared with you at the end of fiscal 'seventeen the progress we have made to become one of the most trusted and respected consumer product companies in the world
we are the leader in the luxury drinks category in mexico with an almost fifty percent share
we will continue to focus on brilliant execution of the six priorities across our markets to drive consistent performance delivery
as we mitigated the impact of inflation and gst with a combination of positive mix
we continue to see solid growth in our three focus areas
the broad-based growth across the business and the three focus areas demonstrates the consistent and effective execution of our strategy through our six execution priorities
reported sales were up just under two percent as organic growth was partially offset by unfavorable exchange
largely as a result of the acceleration of employment benefit cost savings from the second half into the first half which positively impacted margin by thirty five basis points
for the three years ended june twenty nineteen with more of the remaining margin expansion coming through in fiscal 'nineteen as we expect to have less costs to absorb
for the full year i expect our effective interest rate to remain around three percent as we continue to see the benefit from the refinancing with some risk of floating rates rising
crown royal has created the water boys who have engaged tens of thousands of fans at football stadiums and sports bars across america
we have grown the business double digit over the past few years and increased our already high share by more than two hundred and fifty basis points
before i move on to our three focus areas let me share with you the progress we have made on our premium core beer brand guinness
we continued to build on momentum we had on scotch in fiscal 'seventeen growing net sales three percent this solid performance was delivered while working through headwinds in some of our markets
it is aged for at least twelve years expertly crafted by our small team of twelve blenders and is widely recognized by whiskey experts
brazil is a good example of how we are using formats as an nrm tool small formats enable more accessible price points and extend our access to new consumer occasions
in december we announced that we surpassed a year early our target to collect five million pledges to never drink and drive by activating join the pact campaigns in over forty countries
we've done this with a shift from a seeding model with presence in three cities to national presence and also expanding from trend-leading accounts into the broader premium accounts universe
we have embedded productivity in the mexican business to drive out costs to invest in growth this has resulted in savings being delivered across the five productivity work streams
due to challenging market conditions in the export channels in CCA growth slowing in colombia driven by recent tax increases and price increases in mexico
whiskey is the most preferred spirit among high net worth individuals and this trend is accelerating there's been a boom in whiskey-led bars nationwide with more than three hundred bars in china now
looking to the full year our expectations for fiscal 'eighteen remain unchanged we continue to expect organic net sales growth
partially offset by increased ebitda moving now to exchange
basic eps increased thirty six percent due to the balance sheet remeasurement of our us deferred tax liabilities as a result of the headline rate reduction resulting in an exceptional tax credit
we will now raise the goal to collect fifty million pledges
our six priorities underpin the delivery of our strategy disciplined execution of our six priorities across the business is enabling the delivery of consistent results
we have a strong innovation agenda aimed at recruiting consumers into spirits aligned with the three global pillars of recruit re-recruit and disrupt
of organic operating margin improvement in the three years ending fiscal twenty nineteen and our performance ambition
so a bit too early to really see whether it's all according to plan or whether it is one or two weeks longer as it sometime
happens nevertheless i would say that will probably slightly impact our q two for care chemicals but no reason to
as of june thirty two thousand and sixteen the increase was primarily driven by the samsung payment received during the quarter
to now include a streamline approach of licensing our know-how and intellectual property as we build out our ip business development function
and we continue to have confidence in the strengths of our IP we remained optimistic about the future monetization opportunities in the gaming market
the replacement of the mechanical home button the use of haptics within their phone's applications and the opening of their api to allow the development of new applications utilizing haptic effects
that includes certain noncash benefits and expenses associated with our international tax structure in addition to normal gaap metrics
in addition google launched their two new pixel smartphones which both utilize the benefits of haptics these are further exciting examples of the expansion of haptic use across the mobile market
medical revenues were down forty six percent and as growth in the other lines of business outpaces the medical market we expect this transition in our revenue mix to continue
regarding our ongoing litigation with apple the markman hearing took place on october eighteen as a reminder this is the claim construction hearing
be able to ensure zero harm we have a responsibility to our people
we flagged six months ago that there would be identified headwinds from contractual increases in input costs
the programs has so far generated more than one thousand three hundred ideas and initiatives with individual initiatives benefits ranging from thousands of dollars to multimillions over fiscal year 'seventeen and beyond
that means our cover remains very healthy which is well above any of our banking requirements of two and our own internal target of five the
wires from the roof et cetera and then the second one is how it is right now how -- the trials that we have done we have done already two trials we have
so you will notice that we're not changing the outlook from what we said six months ago over the past six months we have seen some normalization of mine plans and we believe that this will continue but it will be gradual
but once it's in operation we can run at fifty percent by campaign and it's quite manageable so that's the first thing there are three large contracts that will be coming in the next years but they don't come -- one of them is
i would divide between where is the prices now and what is the impact on our contracts which are two different things we sort of think we are at the bottom of the cycle of price declines
in the regions of the world where you have available uan it is a very effective and efficient fertilizer
in line with previous year's ebit highlighting a stabilization of earnings after the volatility that had been apparent over recent years
and then i think one of the standouts over the last twelve eighteen months has been the balance sheet remediation that you've delivered beyond the obvious things i was wondering just if you could give us some ideas your thoughts as to what the benefits of that are to the business
with more investors while we have done well over the last twelve months to reduce our debt level and manage working capital downwards i would like to mention that the working capital increase over the year due to the scheduled turnarounds that i've mentioned
this touches every part of our organization we have involved more than one thousand orica people across the globe to review the whole business and consider all factors that create value
so as is clearly illustrated loading operations on blast holes are significantly complicated by the presence of wires so you see the two pictures that i draw your attention so this is how the traditional
would it be right to say that as you roll forward into 'eighteen in fact the opposite applies because of the contract cycle it becomes important for you to show that the plant can operate on a consistent basis
a little bit it's not business determining but it will have an interesting impact on the ebit interesting
we feel very confident with the flexibility of our balance sheet and our current ltv level which will better enable us to create value via our stated strategy
we always said that one quarter in this business is not really important
i don't think anyone can call me responsible if i took the position with how the retail business is going to look in twenty or twenty five years is almost impossible to predict today
initially this was a small asset and an acquisition of its own and there were probably two reasons why we decided to go ahead with it
many of you know this product has been a core bedrock of our portfolio over the past nine years however
note the three points in time highlighted in these pie charts you can see that our portfolio has changed over the past nine years
and finally if you turn to slide fourteen let me summarize we believe this is an environment where capital preservation is important
and i emphasize we are not an agency reit we just find this sector to be the most attractive in the current tight rate global risk environment and so we've have allocated our capital in this direction
the document may be found on the company's website under investor center as well as on the sec website
and having the flexibility to strategically deploy capital is also important we manage our business looking out past the horizon of the next two quarters
you saw the personnel change in washington dc in the executive branch and you saw what happened over the first month that they were in office and how many
the slide presentation may be referenced by clicking on the dynex capital first quarter twenty seventeen earnings conference call link on the presentation page of the website
spread tightened on these assets throughout the quarter we have been a steady investor in this product sector for the past seven years as this strategy has consistently provided excellent return opportunities
we'll also be tracking who will be the new fed governors we've got five new governors that potentially
we will address the ott substitution market in the coming weeks with a new innovative product for the marketplace which the street will hear about
initiatives undertaken at bell media and bell wireline in q four of 'fifteen we also took advantage of favorable market conditions and a sustained low interest rate environment during the quarter to successfully complete
and then services even in the province of manitoba that mts may have purchased from other carriers such as zayo we'll obviously make sure we supply those through bell so those are some of the
and as we look through 'seventeen we will through this year and exit the year with the fastest wireless network in all major cities in the country
increment of the acquired mts assets that related mainly to customer relationships
that shows the accretiveness of that transaction of five percent to ten percent but beyond that can't give you any
if we are in the line where i hope we will be we should be close to about one million customers on our fibre footprint by the end of the year
this represents our best result in almost two years and it was realized despite the significant competitive and regulatory pressures that existed in the quarter
reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap measures is included in our earnings press release and available on our website
and was up over two hundred percent from the year ago period as we accelerated the completion of a large number of previously awarded caf ii sites
do the current services contracts kind of extend through the entire caf life cycle and we might see some deflationary impact kind of as we hit another caf deadline in years to come
but i will give you a little inkling into q four we are taking on shipments
off of services margins in q four and that's been a clear goal of ours since we figured out what we're doing here as we look into next year
this new addition to our giga family of products is off to a rapid ramp with nearly two hundred customers placing orders prior to general availability
to the subscriber edge exos is built for a future where boundless complexity of the subscriber edge can be managed and monetized by the service provider
where we're going as a business and thinking through the deployment services and speaking to the caf part first
a-c-a-m and we've actually been very positive on that now being in place and allowing that portion of the market to go forward and not have uncertainty so they can invest so we see both of those proceeding at pace
the investment in our it infrastructure builds a more scalable foundation allows us to automate the growing demands of our business
importantly based on the remaining twenty seventeen caf ii sites to be closed out this year and the continued implementation of process improvements on new projects
as well as the positive benefits as we leverage our axos platform by accelerating product development at lower incremental costs and reduced time frames
there's two things going on here with services going forward one is that we are increasing our mix
has been when we bought first federal a number of years ago they were obviously a thrift and so there was a lot of one to four on the balance sheet
we've been bringing that number down over the last few years and now it's really getting to be close more closely in line with traditionally where we've kind of kept our one to four family book
and then i think the last thing i would -- or two other things we're continuing to still recruit very well on the mortgage side so we're continuing to add originators and then the last piece
and most of the money center banks or the brokerage houses are obviously at a much higher level so i think that mix of those three things tends to work very well for us
our european and asia pacific effective tax rate was thirty four percent reflecting higher rates on our european profits from legislation changes and the impact of a loss in asia pacific
we will leverage our tca execution and platform solutions to provide scalable products that are valued by our clients to capture this market
i am excited to be back at itg and i'm confident that the best is yet to come for our clients our shareholders and our employees
our total revenues declined slightly as compared with the third quarter two thousand and fifteen but that was largely due to the impact of the strong month of july on our third quarter results
on slide fifteen we break out the expected impact of the energy research sale on our annual revenues and expenses going forward
thank you jt and thank all of you for joining the call this morning it is great to be back on the itg team
and europe and asia-pacific operations as well as our corporate activity as a reminder corporate activity includes investment income and other gains as well as costs not associated with operating itg's regional and product group business lines including among others
as we build on itg's proud three-decade legacy to continue to ramp up client momentum and deliver sustainable margin improvement
although adjusted fourth quarter two thousand and fifteen results were not positive we did make steady progress on our recovery from the lows after the sec settlement last summer and we closed the sale of energy research
although we have been negatively affected by the imposition of us tariffs on imports from china the effect is not material to overall results if the environment continues to shift we are well positioned to deal with changing circumstances
the other benefit is the creation of unique market opportunities let me provide two practical examples one opportunistic the other more strategic
in short on a three-year basis our performance fits the growth model we talked about at our investor day with clear acceleration over the last year
customers continue to validate the attractiveness of the combination and are already showing us possibilities we've previously did not see such as integration of data feeds from our transportation business into the construction erp systems
and be able to do a better job of account management which has been kind of a recurring theme fairly publicly over the last five years in terms of things we need to get done but i would say it's really access
are subject to risks and uncertainties trimble's actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors detailed in the company's form ten-k and ten-q or other documents filed with the securities and exchange commission
this need for technology extends beyond farming operations to elements of infrastructure logistics and processing and will result in a need for solutions from all four trimble segments
and ahead of expectations looking at the results for the first and second quarters we remain favorably positioned in the market and we are raising guidance for the year let's start on slide seven with the review of the second quarter results
slide nine provides the geographic revenue mix in the company the mueller acquisition in combination with organic growth in europe shifted our mix towards europe this quarter as compared to the same quarter last year
plethora of different systems that are tied together or will you be forced at some point to consolidate crm systems and invest significantly in it
yes i think it probably is a point of emphasis that has grown over the last five years
in may i will loosely follow the content starting on slide four this quarter's narrative remains more or less the same as those of the last year emphasizing strength across both businesses and regions
the geospatial segment when compared to twenty fifteen has a lower relative exposure to oil and gas and a generally more diverse book of business
and the other three reporting segments each posting about ten percent organic growth in short all reporting segments in all major geographies continued to perform
three comments first the annual range does not include the anticipated benefits of non-gaap revenue adjustments in the first and second quarters
i view that as an enabling technology to help us go after the market opportunity the more it's a transactional side in the erp system
yes jerry that one has played out a little different than the hypothesis we had coming into the year and it appears to be maybe a quarter or two behind where we thought it would be
more importantly all three organizations have identified significant market upsides that are available through collaboration
these numbers are highlighted on slide four from a software revenue mix perspective we continue to see more of our software moving toward subscription business model offerings
when we publish our third quarter actuals we will also be updating our first and second quarter non-gaap actual results to reflect this common measurement this measurement will eliminate the noise associated with negative purchase accounting effects that are most pronounced in the software acquisitions
maybe refer more specifically kind of to the deal flow that we have seen over now the last nine months or so
the technology now enable solutions that were not necessarily possible five years ago it is attracting
that really the technology has advanced to the point within the last five years so that trimble five to ten years ago was talking in a construction firm to the equipment manager
this program is an ongoing program and we continue to evaluate such further opportunities across our network of over a hundred production facilities
especially in regards to the ramp-up of the app mill so what have you been hearing about the ramp-up speed of that mill if you hear from your agents or clients
second we are opening up two new segments by bringing innovation into power management for computing systems and for tvs and set-top boxes
i think even on a flat volume in 'seventeen we would expect our mobile business revenue to grow and the reason for that is essentially
and somewhat diminished what was otherwise a very strong performance during q three the first of these relates to malaysian airline system or mas which is restructuring to address difficult financial issues
they all have their own characteristics and like i said the two hundred er is probably the weak point in the market as far as that generation and i feel far more optimistic about the rest of the group
given the sale activity and acquisition activity it's very hard to kind of keep track of that over the course of the year i was wondering if you might just be able to say -- i think you mentioned four aircraft
our losses at mas consist of future rentals as well as compensation for maintenance value consumed during the term of the contract which was to be due at lease expiry we'll be pursuing remedies for this but would say that the approach taken here is disappointing
in connection with our annual fleet review and as part of our strategy to accelerate our exit from older freighters we decided to scrap our last six remaining seven four seven converted freighters when their current leases expire
we remain focused on increasing earnings producing strong cash roe and delivering sustainable operating cash flows we continue to successfully execute our disciplined growth strategy
if creditors are ultimately treated unfairly we expect mas as well as other malaysian state-controlled enterprises won't be able to benefit from the same kind of implicit trust the financial community has placed in them for decades past
acquiring a large portfolio will clearly be transformative maybe that helps win an ig rating is that something you guys would be willing to do at the right price we would
okay and just on the e two s is there a geographic region that's showing greater interest than we might expect
i'm glad to report we have no other aircraft with mas the seven seven seven we repossessed is the only one of its kind in our fleet and is seventeen years old
and i just wanted to walk you through the main drivers in two thousand and fifteen of that capital book decrease so the first one was the small shortfall in our operating cash flow compared to our dividend
at any time that i've seen in the last five years so on the ground money that you can get very attractive rates of return on
a decent chunk of aum there we do make some positive ebitda contribution as we do in almost all of our resource businesses now but it's certainly not taken off the way we thought it would
over the past four years we've invested in nearly every aspect of our business to position the firm for future growth
since that time we successfully transitioned most of sam's active aum from legacy funds to new diversified strategies
the numbers that we came up with were fairly low because the overall loan book is about fifteen loans as you know
institutions are looking at gold in a very very different way than they did in the last five years so we are seeing the pace of institutional presentations picking up
such as ffo and adjusted ebitda you can find this information together with reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure in yesterday's earnings release
improving margins grouping up and unlocking embedded value through our roi projects
group strength primarily came from corporate group which was up thirty five percent this is particularly encouraging as we think about group business going forward
we will keep you posted on our progress as the marketing process for the initial phase of phase two unfolds as well as any progress made on the subsequent set of assets in the months ahead
setting the stage for what we believe will be a banner group year for our portfolio we witnessed notable improvements in two thousand nineteen pace in key markets like chicago and new york throughout the quarter
as described in our filings with the sec these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements
during the quarter we also started the marketing process for the sale of four additional noncore assets as the initial part of phase two of our capital recycling program
while ebitda margins increased by fifty basis points at the midpoint to a new range of flat
what an average booking window for a sizable group looks like today versus where we were a year ago or two years ago just so we have a sense of that
to ensure we are targeting the right market subsectors we have looked at the total market size and estimated reasonable expectations of our growth rates we can attain in them from this we have put together a three-year outlook on where the company revenues could be
and by the end of that period overcome our depreciation burden to attain positive gaap earnings
as we look out over the balance of twenty nineteen we expect continued contribution from the international oilfield sector for both technology and base ceramic products
looking at contract manufacturing we expect continued grow throughout twenty nineteen while some clients have postponed decisions on project awards we are making progress in other areas by expanding the products we produce
we believe this is one of the reasons residential sales were up only three point five percent in the second quarter
due to the high demand for our beacon software we have recently encountered a bottleneck in developing the necessary interfaces between beacon and the billing systems used by both current and potential customers
or potential customers in the backlog who want to install beacon and want to start using our products
for each new beacon application it's necessary for us to map our database to the database in the customer system
now let me address a matter that's been of concern to many people over the past two months on may four of this year we announced that the company was exploring on a preliminary basis various options to enhance shareholder value
normally our normal backlog on something like this is about fifty now fifty even sounds a lot for a normal run rate but you have to understand there's a lot of customers who
trying to introduce electronic meters but if you look carefully at what they're offering they may have only one size
now on to the results yesterday after the market closed we released our second quarter twenty sixteen results sales for the second quarter of twenty sixteen were a record for any quarter while earnings and earnings per share were second quarter records
were up thirty five percent margins were strong again aided by lower copper prices although that benefit has been diminishing as copper prices have risen somewhat over the past sixty days and the relative benefit compared to the prior year's quarters has decreased
unfortunately many of our customers do not have sufficient it personnel internally to rapidly provide us with the necessary information which has caused a slowdown in this process and a corresponding slowdown in new orders
we further stated that there could be no assurance that any action will be taken as a result of this exploration we have made no additional comments since the may four announcement
are waiting for their vendor to get them the number -- get them the data so they can send it over to us so there's always this period of time delay from the time somebody says i want to use beacon until we can get the thing installed
and so we are working with that provider to try and get that provider to map their billing system to beacon but that provider doesn't have a lot of resources to work with us
but in each case you have to be able to take that beacon data that has been brought into beacon from the water meter
another option is to bypass that provider try to go right to the sap system that all of these entities are using and we're also looking at that
due to these market conditions coal utilization has dropped noticeably in the first few months as compared to twenty fifteen the question we're wrestling with is whether this is a temporary change
and then pick right up back on our growth trajectory as we move into 'seventeen so we still feel really good about the business it's the right business for us to be in
so we did have a little bit of a benefit i would say in global power from timing in q one we had a couple of projects we've been performing very well on
some of the challenges they have there and some of the solutions that we provide so it's not a commentary at all on 'sixteen but like everybody else we can look at the coal generation numbers in the first quarter of two thousand and sixteen and they were down
also on today's call the company may provide non-gaap information regarding certain of its historical results and twenty sixteen outlook to supplement the results provided in accordance with gaap this information should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for the comparable gaap measures
global power segment had a good quarter with a nineteen percent increase in gross profit that was driven by higher volume and upside provided from a couple of well-executed projects that are nearing completion
so all else being equal if we had two equal opportunities and one was a little bit more -- one was international and one was domestic
i wouldn't expect it to keep at that run rate necessarily nor would i expect it to be a large loss going forward we make a little bit of money in the china jv and at least right now
global services had a four percent increase in revenue but the gross profit was down as the mix of work in the quarter favored construction services which is the lowest margin work in that segment
remember that our fourth quarter twenty fifteen free cash flow was quite strong in part due to the achievement of billing milestones that allowed us to collect cash in the fourth quarter which was reflected in the year-end cash position
in the broader industrial sector we just hadn't seen it in two thousand and fifteen we built a little bit of that conservatism into two thousand and sixteen and that was part of the reason for stepping down the growth
on a normalized basis we would tend to lose a little bit of money in the indian jv there's just not enough work going through that we will lose less in the indian jv post the decision to pay down the high interest loan
but after about thirty days the inhibitory mechanisms that we keep talking about with a tumor take over and the tumors begin to grow
the good thing about this is it's a multi-company collaboration that's sponsored by the nci where a number of different companies have agreed
somewhere in the region of almost ten subjects enrolled so it's very few subjects that actually enrolled and is primary looking at the safety
of the booster vaccine at week zero and these are the data that we've previously reported
and the reason these fold increases are lower than what we previously reported for the phase ii is that
boost to all five proteins encoded in the protein -- in the vaccine including to the whole virus these responses
as we initiate all of the phase ii studies that are listed on this slide so the first study in red the colorectal cancer indication has already been initiated
if you look at the booster study highlighted in green at week fifty six prior to the annual booster you can see that these responses -- these antibody responses in both groups remained elevated
whereas those who had a strong starting immunity after one year which is the red those who were higher than the median value at the beginning there really isn't a boost effect
for the majority of the proteins encoded in the vaccine remain durable up to week fifty six and again you can see that we can boost them
but it's a way of generating some initial clinical data while actually we continue to work on what we believe could be better candidates coming through for those two approaches
from our work it's clear that you need a much broader immune response kind of mimicking what a natural rsv infection induces
and two findings that we have now found and some of which we've already published is if we vaccinate or inject the vaccine directly into the tumor
and we just saw that it would take a long time for the readout and then we believe we can get the proof-of-concept data we're seeking from the three other studies
our use of the term ebitda throughout this morning's call corresponds with the term adjusted ebitda as defined in our earnings release
and that nov can bring proprietary tools to oilfield service companies to deliver these wellbores we believe that composite technologies will defeat corrosion in the oilfield the most expensive production problem that many of you probably never think about
there is an opportunity for nov tuboscope to inspect the pipe to assure its new owner that it is fit for purpose
despite being based in houston with nearly a hundred facilities on the gulf coast area that was affected by the storm
we are incredibly proud of the organization's tenacity having delivered five quarters in a row of improving results amidst challenging market conditions
we believe that big data and predictive analytics will drive efficiency and that as the largest oem of drilling equipment nov is uniquely positioned to bring automation and big data solutions to the oilfield
one particular pipe service has grown through the past several decades to become a tremendous nov franchise
we believe our growth in this segment continues to outpace global activity levels for three primary reasons
the faster makeup of the connection is partially accomplished by deeper stabbing meaning there are more threads engaged at the time two joints come together which minimizes damage by more evenly distributing stresses on the connection
though we believe customers have mostly exhausted their twenty seventeen budgets and expect lighter bookings and flat revenues through year-end
new novos control system across all these rigs we have a fantastic capability in terms of being machine automation
this makes the oil and gas industry an enormous consumer of steel there are literally hundreds of steel mills around the world that manufacture octg pipe of all sizes weights and grades
good housekeeping seal of approval for pipe transactions a single joint of octg pipe may be inspected several times through its life
is a continuous length of steel tubing typically around two inches in diameter and up to thirty thousand feet in length which is wound on a reel as we manufacture it
and six hundred nov employees were displaced from their homes by floodwaters our thoughts and prayers remain with them and their families as they put their lives back together
allowing them to drill at an average rate seventy nine feet per hour faster than a direct offset which used a standard agitator in colorado the agitator he allowed another customer to drill with twenty two percent less weight on bit
where we expect to be up and running by mid twenty eighteen our completion tools business unit also experienced significant wins in the middle east during the third quarter
for the fourth quarter we expect bookings will taper off as most of our customers' twenty seventeen budgets are exhausted the opportunity to secure tier two pressure pumping equipment has passed and commodity price outlook remains uncertain
one major oil company reported it achieved twenty five percent higher flow rates from its gulf of mexico wells by running internally coated tubulars i would add that the cost of failure of internal coatings is high thousands of feet of peeling thermoset plastic can easily clog up a well
i am particularly proud of the hundreds of fellow nov employees who pitched in to help their coworkers families and friends and neighbors by rescuing those
and we expect this segment will return to a slow steady pace of improvement in twenty eighteen as customer inventories of spare parts are depleted
additionally we received customer commitments for extensive pressure pumping refurbishment programs bringing our committed refurbishments to over a hundred pumping units
innovation that eliminates the need for the use of thrombolytics reducing the likelihood of icu time and bleeding complications that significantly affect patient recovery and outcomes
you had a new product approved in that business you had ten percent growth which is the best growth i've seen in
i had some sense from comments in prior quarters that it was possible you might increase your spending against those two programs if you saw
at the next auction but assuming that there is one for the nine hundred would you also demand that you get the exact same treatment of course
they've already had that spectrum for twenty five years it doesn't help them to keep it for another six months or a year it just i guess harms them less obviously if they don't get the extension and have to shut it down then they have a substantial amount of three G capacity that they're losing
from your observation of the customer behavior how important it is for the operator to have their four g network in the rural area meaning the remote area
is either reduced or zero so it cannot be better than today if you look at it today dtac has a whole range of frequencies
and their customers who are on three G are going to have a worse experience so
do you think advanced's decision to join the bidding for the eighteen hundred would imply that their financial -- would imply advanced's financial strength and nullify the probability of ncpo approving the matter
from third quarter 'eighteen the asset impairments for the depreciable assets were actually taken on the beginning of the second quarter
is there any change in the competitive environment over the past three months which i think we can safely assume means the mobile
so for the first quarter of next year we will have to report on that basis and when that happens the accumulated sac will be
and obviously we're still improving our network particularly in the northeast but that's nothing like building out as we did in twenty sixteen vastly cheaper
for both phases of the recent dif transaction with the one back in november and the one we just did in the second quarter
next question is how much of the sac cost is still left on your balance sheet
in our q three two thousand and eighteen results versus q three of 'seventeen you see this phenomenon with relistor and you're going to see it again when i talk about dermatology and our neurology businesses
entering or exiting certain channels just to understand this dynamic because it sounds like it will be negative in q four but it will be positive next year and how that actually ends up tying into gross to net just wanted to clarify this whole thing
on slide five we've called out some of the highlights that demonstrate our continued progress towards transformation first and foremost our businesses are growing
let's move over to slide nineteen and talk about salix product portfolio we have a number of programs in the works for rifaximin first we're continuing to enroll patients in a study that we initiated earlier this year
we raised our full year adjusted ebitda guidance range for the third time this year
four of the five subsegments posted organic growth and all five saw increased volume over the prior year quarter
to summarize all four of our segments grew organically for the first time in the third quarter
we resolved the xifaxan ip litigation and expect to preserve market exclusivity for our top product
if you think about the magnitude of the impact of the changes that we've been making to these programs where you see it most in terms of improvement in gross to net is in derm that's why you see the impact that you see on our q three quarter results
achieved record sales and base earnings in two thousand and fifteen while we focused on optimizing our industrial segments which faced difficult economic conditions in many of our global markets
and for the first time in two years we are hopeful we won't see a significant winter weather impact to our operations
new york trends are pretty much on what our expectations were i think the one issue might be the corrugated medium machine and what's going on in that industry
and if you go to the website you'll be able to see some of the things that are actually occurring around the can i think it'll give you an idea but continue to be very excited about it also since that meeting in new york we've have had three or four new
additional information about factors that could cause different results and information about the use by the company of non-gaap financial measures is available in today's news release and on the company's website
our outlook for two thousand and sixteen is essentially unchanged from what was provided at our analyst day in december other than it has been adjusted to now reflect a lower weighted average number of shares outstanding
i think that there was a significant winter event in q one that impacted our industrial businesses
more than half of the decline in the earnings for this segment can really be attributed to the impact of our one corrugating medium machine
month or two but you commented on your corrugated medium business obviously slowing and
the pace of change for us is also changing because i six is generating tremendous interest we have over thirty customer engagements today and just everything we're getting all kind of different requests
these niche market kind of products so that will start up later the latter part of this year and we see a lot of interest in that when we go through these i six initiatives so although -- while it is kind of skewed to flexibles and rigid
from an ongoing ebit standpoint it is not really going to have an impact as far as further reducing costs on that business all those costs are really contained in irapuato and there was very little cost here dealing with that particular issue so i don't think we're going to see anything
we could get five hundred of the small customers but they won't make up the revenue that one big customer could
today's presentation is available on the webcast and an audio recording will be provided after the call for the next seven days
we believe that demand for indihome is huge given the fact that indonesia has more than sixty million household
moving to profitability on an adjusted basis we sustained our ebitda and ebitda margin compared with last year
please refer to yesterday's earnings release and our most recent filings with the sec for additional information regarding uncertainties that could affect our future financial results
thanks david good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today we generated solid eps and strong free cash flow and experienced another quarter of strong new business signings in the third quarter
we won business with more than two dozen clients including several important new logos
a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures is available in the news release and on the convergyscom website under investor
this growth was offset by volume fluctuations with several communications clients and certain program completions including the impact of previously divested bpo businesses
so it's all still going the same as i would have said it was going six months ago or a year ago
let me take a moment to update you on our four key drivers for future growth
looking forward it's the pace of change and related uncertainties that make the connected four growth transformational program particularly important
we increased core operating margin by fifty basis points this represents an acceleration of the steady twenty to forty basis points per year of the last few years
in fact in the fourth quarter market volumes declined by almost ten percent our own business is holding up well in these conditions
this will continue in the first half of two thousand and seventeen the savings from this restructuring investment will be progressively realized during this year
of your portfolio so you take for example ice cream as one we were very much in the bulk segment in retail and we've really worked hard over the last four or five years
spreads continues to drag on the total growth of food you may remember that last year we said that the performance of the bcs unit the spreads unit
and that's obviously an enormous -- would be an enormous boost to get them aligned to the ownership agenda as well in the coming two to three years again i want to check if i answered your question
the two challenges that we have if i may say which are not surprising i think any business
and i'm pleased that we are already starting to get early benefits from the mindset shift that comes with our connected four growth program the chart shows many examples where we have more than halved the innovation time for some of our launches
in nigeria we raised our shares further to sixty percent and we bought out the minority shareholding in egypt and surrounding countries
organizational changes we've made in the company and you see the effects coming through even earlier than we expected with the fifty basis points operating expense
connected four growth and that's a fair question but i don't think so i think if you really look at the slightly softer growth that we're seeing
i personally don't think they're related to our move to connected four growth which is absolutely needed and certainly will put the company in a better position as we move forward
will be between three percent to five percent but it will be skewed towards the second half this time much like it was
to continue to drive that down in fact we are slightly disappointed that we haven't driven it down more in two thousand and sixteen may i say
we're going through the next six months still with an enormous effort from everybody in the organization to implement that i'm very confident that we will do that very well
after the unpredictable events in two thousand and sixteen this year promises to be more of the same the upheaval and accelerated change i talked about before
at the heart of connected four growth is the organizational and core process changes
our overheads increased by forty basis points now there are two reasons for this
i will give you now some quick comments about the three divisions and wts and jean-marc boursier will come back later on them with more details
even more interesting it is that all geographies and both es and cms have contributed
if you exclude the ppa impact to get an economic view on our profitability
we keep on being as selective as possible with financial criteria that have been reviewed in the most stringent way since i took on my additional cfo responsibilities
another favorable element to be noted is the price increase we witness for industrial services this is good news for suez
as far as the two voluntary departure plans are concerned please note that in
as you perfectly know h one always sees an unfavorable trend in terms of working capital which will revert back by the end of the year
let us move to slide five here are the main figures of the semester
that was my presentation regarding a solid h one performance i now give the floor back to jean-louis for some concluding remarks
the third message is that our commercial teams are fully mobilized to outperform and definitely contribute to an acceleration of suez growth many contracts have been renewed
another one the prairie program where we are the only utility participating to this new ecosystem gathering the best players around ia issues and solutions
we will have less contribution in q four because the water was already accounted for last year but given where we stand at the end of june given the results
this led to an approximately fifty percent increase in construction material operating income
i would note that the consultant cost savings were concentrated primarily in the second half so fiscal twenty seventeen will reflect those relative savings early in the year
increase in interest expense in twenty sixteen was primarily attributable to increased borrowings we continue to pursue the sale of noncore assets where appropriate
revenue growth was driven by an average price increase of approximately nine percent for the year on marginally lower volumes
as of february twenty nine twenty sixteen we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants through that date and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future
thank you fiscal twenty sixteen was a rewarding year in which the hard work difficult choices and strategic decision-making of the past few years has lead to a significant improvement in our financial performance
including those risk factors discussed in the company's most recent form ten-k filed in may
overall we feel we made significant progress in fiscal twenty sixteen although we believe there are further opportunities for improvement
and with our peers reconciliations of non-gaap measures to the nearest corresponding gaap measure
once you adjust for the impact of closed and signed asset sales we had underlying production growth of three percent compared to our second quarter production last year
norway was plus seven oh oh oh again we had better uptime and well performance but also some increased gas offtake in the summer
thank you ellen and good morning i'll start on slide four which summarizes the progress we've made during the second quarter on our key strategic financial and operational objectives
if you turn to slide five i'll review the quarter financials in more detail
if you'll turn to slide nine i'll cover some operational highlights from the rest of the portfolio
the project is on track and first production is expected by the end of twenty eighteen so those were just a few of the operational highlights from the first quarter now let's move to slide ten to discuss the remainder of the year
our cautionary statement is shown on page two of today's presentation deck we will make some forward-looking statements during today's call that refer to estimates and plans
this was an opportunistic addition based on attractive contracting terms we expect to average about twelve rigs
we'll talk more obviously in november about our outlooks and our plans for two thousand eighteen and i think we'll be in a better position to talk about
we just concluded the ninety-day operational phase of the two train lenders test in july
yes i mean i think in twenty nineteen you'll see something that will probably look -- start to look to you like manufacturing mode as that infrastructure becomes available to us
really driven by better uptime and some better well performance we were plus ten thousand in malaysia
last year in november on the fourteen of november we have announced that we have changed our organization
managing some annuities in france and part of the indexation previously was paid by the state we are referring to very old annuities dating from sixty years ago
on your second question about owned funds i just wanted to make two remarks
the only area where we have been considering share buybacks is in the event of the ipo and what we have said is the following and this is still true we've said that
it is not from one geography or from one operation it is across the board from all geographies that have contributed to this excellent performance
at the same time the underlying earnings have grown by eleven percent and we have continued to invest and to realize
that three large us institutions have put themselves together to make sure that they work on exactly that topic that has shown to me that we are on the right journey
we have tried our best to anticipate with all the changes pre-ipo that we've shown you in our investor day in november to anticipate as much as possible
in case we do the ipo we will have some funds to reallocate into the lines of business that we want to grow
this result has been fueled by a very good performance across all the geographies that axa has
we have also realized a significant improvement in the underlying earnings growth of twenty percent those are the markets
and you can look at this for all these six geographies the key is how can we grow with our customer base
people will always talk to you at axa about a focus in health
which has caused france to be in a very difficult and miserable situation in the first half of two thousand and seventeen and given this situation and also given the fact
the guarantee in the new business is very close to zero so the dilution i would say of the in-force brings the overall guarantee down
was very much about mortality of people that are one hundred years and beyond so that i would call on the outskirts
is a very strong contributor to the overall results we are a strong market leader in france we are in the top three everywhere and despite the fact
thinking back we have six countries where we are very strong in health
and then my final question was just on the operating variances within the afr because
you probably know that q one is by far our smallest quarter due to relative seasonality in some of our businesses nevertheless we're encouraged by some of those results
so before we open to questions let me wrap up in a few words we are rather pleased with q one since we are making progress on the initiatives that we highlighted as our priorities
but not only by the carryover impact of the selling price increase of two thousand and eighteen but also
maybe it is related to the nim contraction and if we will see
since i came to hamburg now six months ago i visited all regions and major markets that i was not directly responsible for in the past
from the automotive industry in the second half of the year the direct industry segment grew by nine point one percent thanks to the strong demand from the electronics and automotive sectors
pretty much as large as nivea clearly it's across more categories but it's clearly showing that you can deliver very strong
and although the decision to leave after ten years the dynamic world of the emerging growth markets has been an emotional one i'm very excited to have joined the headquarters to take the helm of the company
the plus underlies our commitment that care will make beiersdorf even stronger in the future
this covers a population of an extra eight hundred million that we will have to build up step-by-step following the key success factors of india
the effectiveness is proven to visibly reduce dark spots in eight weeks
after six years of board responsibility for the near east and the americas regions
good morning ladies and gentlemen i admit to sit here as ceo of the company is a very different experience
these three pillars are also the areas in which external growth opportunities
we continue to perform well in quarter four with growth above the selected segment
starting almost from symbolically maybe from west to east stepping up nigeria where we entered in two thousand and sixteen establishing also a local production capacity
from my natural habitat in which i lived and worked for the last twenty eight years apart from a very short period i've always worked in the market in many countries very close to the consumer
the impact of the acquisitions resulted in a negative sixty basis points mainly due to the purchase price allocation effect
has been no balance sheet deployment in over ten years and of course this is the second
i think the eleven years is maybe an exceptional long period to drive something which is very impactful but that is certainly one that we will have to continue to do
certainly 'nineteen 'twenty that productivity gains will be also reinvested in the company in the first place in order to get
risk factors management discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations set forth in investors bancorp's filings with the sec
with an allowance coverage of almost two hundred percent a strong credit history and excess capital we believe we are well positioned should the economy decline
we believe that growing the bank organically and through prudent acquisitions has served us well as a public company and through our second step five years ago
we are a stronger bank today than when we completed the second step five years ago
since the first quarter of 'eighteen over the last five months we have changed our retail leadership and have added new resources to our retail deposit and business lending teams
on our executive management team eleven of the fifteen members are new to the bank since two thousand fourteen we need to execute on our plan and lead our teams with passion and purpose
and while we're continuing that at a healthy pace of over one hundred basis points
report a quarter four but we probably should have because it was such a big adjustment from a year ago so i apologize for that so we want to clear that out today about what happened
we -- that's not going to inhibit anything we do one other thing i would tell you about three weeks ago i got to go to dallas because we got named
germany has been very strongly affected both on the retail side as the food service side by adverse weather condition in the first four month of the year
to becoming the market-leading hybrid reit expanding our ability to further invest in areas across the agency residential credit
i was just wondering if after the hts acquisition goes through
a of strategic and financial combination so thirty percent of the market cap the total market cap was actually taken out while it doubled so i think -- and that was a healthy way for the best companies
as i will describe further value and yield investing in certain sectors of equity market has clearly become more rewarding and more easily defensible in two oh one six the
there is a clear and present opportunity to attract the growing investor flows rotating into yield sectors today sectors which are more highly valued than the mortgage reit industry
the first quarter of two thousand sixteen continued to be the type of challenging environment we've been preparing for
in my remarks last quarter i also discussed our outlook for two thousand sixteen i stated that because of our diversified platform and low leverage profile we were positioned to
in a market that is clearly in search for yield i also wanted to address the relative valuations of the mortgage reit sector
we spent much of the first quarter evaluating the potential fit of the hatteras portfolio with our own assets and we continue to feel positive about the combination of the two portfolios
i'm really curious i think the thing that surprised us the most during the quarter during the first quarter was the volatility around agency mbs i would've thought that in a
has a lot to do with the level of rates what we saw in q one was a very sharp rally
a rate which outpaces the growth of the global economy by more than three times over the same period
in stark contrast to the situation at the time of our last conference call the publicly traded capital markets have improved significantly over the last two months
for example the sale of employee benefits to sun life financial closed on march one we expect the dividend cash proceeds to the holding company starting this quarter subject to regulatory approval
for the full year we continue to expect growth in net operating income weighted towards the second half of twenty sixteen new mobile programs
the houses that are in default or in reo-type status if you think about our field services so we are not
today's call will contain other non-gaap financial measures which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance
net earned premium and fees for multi-family housing were up more than twenty percent we achieved this increase through our affinity channel and expanded relationships with property management companies
as a reminder first quarter twenty fifteen benefited from a tax consolidating adjustment that reversed itself during the course of last year
that linked to mortgage originations but we do expect over time as we continue to gain share and demonstrate the value of our capabilities in our compliance that we'll grow that business eight percent to twelve percent a year on the top line yes i think the key there is
for more details on these measures the most comparable gaap measures and a reconciliation of the two please refer to the news release and financial supplement available at assurantcom
these offerings now account for twenty seven percent of the segment's revenue and are expected to continue to grow at double digits in the long term
the release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant dot COM as noted in the release beginning in the first quarter twenty sixteen we revised the presentation of assurant's results to focus on housing and lifestyle
revenue at solutions increased five percent from the prior period in twenty fifteen driven by a higher volume of covered mobile devices globally and strong growth in vehicle protection
that will increase the supply of natural gas to the new york city area by about four hundred million a day
among those predictable sources will be the new long-term supply and transportation agreement with nova that was highlighted in our april announcement of the geismar sale
that effort in the ovm area and really excited to see the kind of development that is going on we're getting a tremendous amount of well connect requests
the drivers of growth and the leverage for instance the operating leverage we have in the northeast and what volumes mean to us in terms of ebitda there
glad you could join us today and i plan to keep my remarks pretty brief today to allow as much time as possible for your individual questions and also recognizing we have our analyst day coming up next week on may eleven in new york city
depending on the application these devices are required to maintain their performance specifications for up to twenty five years
however not yet seen an improvement in the market and we expect mocvd investments to remain soft
we enter twenty sixteen with what i believe to be the strongest and most competitive product portfolio in veeco's history
a key supplier in asia we started to win some new accounts new osat accounts that we had not been in
global economic uncertainty and slow growth in china continued to dampen led tv demand
these factors are discussed in the business description and management's discussion and analysis sections of the company's report on form ten-k an annual report to shareholders
led prices decline even though it appears to me the decline rate compared to a year ago is somewhat less
that oversupply needs to get used up and it will get used up as led lighting penetration continues to grow
in q four in q one we are continuing to buy our shares so we are executing that program we believe it is a good investment at this time for our capital to buy back our own shares
i would like to see both systems and service grow at the same time and still maintain somewhere around twenty five percent to thirty percent but both the business grow at the same time
few have announced plans to shift into more profitable applications or to exit led production altogether
with waferetch our flexible process offers cost advantages versus incumbent technologies waferetch also promises substantial cost savings for the tsv reveal process
things have improved slightly but they are still in the same -- broadly in the same situation that they have been over the last six months
generate a lot more revenue from other opportunities like advanced packaging mems and rf as well as
certain non-gaap measures will be discussed on this call we have provided a description of those measures as well as a discussion of why we believe this information to be useful in our form eight-k furnished to the sec this morning
as we stated throughout the prior year while our fiscal two thousand and sixteen results were disappointing as a direct result of the record warm temperatures throughout the heating season
thank you anuradha i would like to welcome everybody to this call and appreciate your joining us for the discussion on the results of the third quarter of fiscal twenty sixteen let's begin with details of some of the key developments of the quarter
zee will continue to offer quality entertainment to audiences both home and abroad across various consumption platforms
so how do you -- how should we look at it from a two- three-year perspective will it sort of stabilize and probably increase in line with your other expenses or your advertising and publicity will tend to be more like a percentage of revenues
the channel delivered a weekly average of twelve shows among the top fifty shows during the quarter
of which the data will also be presented in q three so these are very important moments in the history of the company
cost efficiency initiatives that will continue to benefit the margins but since the two segments are close to all-time highs
can you just speak to how confident you are that you can sustain operating margins in the forty percent range
overall the chc international segment realized strong performance in the quarter as the team continued to actively integrate sales strategies with promotional programs
this is a great position to be in and we will continue to work hard in our efforts to ensure millions of ibs-c and chronic constipation patients
with the continued focus on investment in the brand against the backdrop of strong linzess revenue growth
i think that is kind of the brand that we want to have in terms of how we approach the payer but i think we feel good about where we are with linzess we think 'seventeen looks good and so far the early signs in zurampic look very encouraging
as the market leader we will continue to innovate by seeking to improve the clinical profile and expand the clinical utility of linzess to better serve an even broader patient population
the majority of these patients are dissatisfied with currently available treatment options primarily otc laxatives and
but i think the most encouraging thing is we are literally at the table with all ten of the major payers right now
to take both medications at the same time in one pill which we believe will help drive physician adoption and further growth in the category
where we are today we're trading at less than six x revenue multiples so i think there's a lot of opportunity for
patients who see predominantly a gi attack and how you would
the interim results from part one were very encouraging especially considering this was a small number of patients with frequent attacks treated over a relatively short period
the first exploratory trial we plan to run in this setting is zenith-one and it's planned to begin this summer bill will go into more detail on this and the rationale in a moment
before we begin our remarks i want to direct your attention to slide two which discusses our use of forward-looking statements and potential risk factors
we designed part one of the trial to exceed the drug trough levels that we expect to be necessary to effectively manage the disease and we succeeded in doing this with a daily dose of three hundred and fifty milligrams
to round out the update let me review the status of the rest of our pipeline we continue to make progress expanding the availability of rapivab by gaining approval in canada in january and filing for approval in europe earlier this year
first i would like to review the plan for completion of apex-one this trial in hae patients
we look forward to seeing the results of parts two and three of the trial which will study lower doses bill will provide an overview of what will be in the second interim analysis of apex-one shortly
we have also recently filed a supplemental new drug application with the fda to expand the treatment age for rapivab down to two years old based on the data from an ongoing trial in pediatric patients
this will include all subjects enrolled in parts one and two and per the protocol and the statistical analysis plan placebo subjects will be pooled from both parts for analysis
patients will not be required to come to a clinic or a hospital to do that each subject will participate for a total of three angioedema attacks with blinded trial therapy delivered in a randomized sequence
in order to do that you have to have all of the previous doses taken in the morning so that you can administer a morning dose on the day that the subject attends the clinic for the serial pk draws
also meritor specifically announced uqm as one of their two strategic partners in this product line
customer and market for uqm i also want to mention that our longtime partners proterra and zenith will continue to be strong customers
beyond the major oem that we're dealing with so by far the hottest market in the world for fuel cells is china and a couple of facts on that market of what they've targeted is
that however we're going to capitalize to support our jv into china and to look at these other markets
again as a reminder the cfius process approval only applies to the proposed foreign investment in uqm and has no jurisdiction
in order to facilitate our growth through two thousand eighteen and to support our growing demand for delivery later this year we have made some investments during the quarter
shipments of the dt systems to ashok leyland have commenced and we continue the dialogue at the highest levels of ashok leyland on furthering our partnership as we continue to work on our expansion into the india ev market
another customer that has kept our plant very busy over the past few months is keshi with their electric mining vehicle application
would be a great opportunity for uqm and potentially lead to additional business in the region
jointly discuss what the impact of cfius holding up the investment from sinotruk is going to have and how they would like to approach it as well and then i can -- we'll know much better after those meetings
during his speech jay made two major announcements first was the introduction of their new brand with a wide range of electrification options of axles called blue horizon
as their first major customer and application for electrification peterbilt will electrify a number of class eight transport and refuse trucks as first adopters working with the meritor e-axle
we have started the initial shipments of our dt systems to ashok for their pilot build -- bus builds and we expect these shipments to continue over the next few months
as previously reported keshi placed their first production order with us and we are in the full launch and build mode for this product line and we will begin shipping the initial systems to keshi in china during this quarter
looking back on the coda business is a lot of these contracts require significant deposits before we
our future continues to look very bright for uqm as the commercial electrical vehicle market is continuing increase in its market adoption and i want to thank everyone again for your ongoing support and we look forward to another exciting quarter
in closing i'd like to commend our entire team for the solid and steady record of growth and profitability they have produced over the past six years since our ipo a track record we can be very proud of within our industry
followed by comments about our fourth quarter investment activity and the performance of our investment portfolio and then offer views about two thousand eighteen and then
so against the backdrop of a healthy market environment we'll stay the course in terms of our game plan for two thousand eighteen sticking with the strategies that have served us well and produced a strong track record since we've been public
as we discussed during our call on march twenty three the acquisition will strengthen and help grow the core of our business
i'd also like to mention that in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap during our call we will discuss several non-gaap financial measures
the lit business is now fully integrated and continues to play an important role in several of our major programs
i'll turn now to our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of twenty sixteen we believe that mercury's market opportunities and backlog position us to continue delivering solid revenue growth in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
adjusted ebitda excludes depreciation interest income and expense as well as income taxes in addition to the exclusions for adjusted income from continuing operations
adjusted income from continuing operations exclude several items from gaap income from continuing operations
however in accordance with gaap mercury intelligence systems isn't -- is reflected in our statement of cash flows
we're launching our melanoma indication in more than fifty markets globally and we are preparing for launches in additional tumors
as we accelerate the launch of keytruda around the world our researchers are continuing to study keytruda with an extensive clinical development program that spans a multitude of cancer types
we are making good progress with the zepatier launch we're having favorable conversations with payers and we've garnered some early wins in both the public
this recommendation has now been ratified by the european commission i'll remind you that zepatier is not cleared by the kidney and can be used in patients irrespective of baseline renal function
i've said repeatedly that i expect that keytruda by virtue of the spectrum of its activity will prove to be foundational in future cancer care
incorporated into the existing filing for keynote-oh ten we have seen the agency moving that way before but
and we really have not gotten nrdl approval for januvia in china yet so once that's achieved i think that that represents another opportunity for us
and we are seeing increased uptake and utilization of our hpv vaccine around the world
relates to is the irs allows you for orphan drug clinical trials so if you have a drug that has a
substituting therapeutically even existing patients so i do believe that we're going to continue to see erosion for remicade that the biosimilar impacts are accelerating and they're going to continue
which were partially offset by declines in remicade and nasonex i'll now highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches and i'm going to begin with oncology
subsequently the fda has requested additional information to enable their review of the zinplava file with the result that a new action date of october twenty three has been set
and as i said the va continues to ramp up nicely so we're encouraged by the access that we're getting and now we have to work to build market share and that's what we're going to focus on as we move forward in terms of the
productivity will continue to play a significant role in two thousand and nineteen and our stage two initiatives are just about planned out with execution commencing in the new year
and plans to break ground in new markets in two thousand and nineteen and jumpstart is undoubtedly a key contributor as our brand strength continues to grow
we know the importance of strong partnerships with national brands and saw some great successes in q three through our partnerships with sodastream instant pot lagostina and the rock cookware
and patricia it's the other greg i would just say it would stand to reason that issuance and redemption would be way up in mark's and fcl because it's net new but
consistent performance like what we've seen in q three is the result of decisions we've made eighteen to thirty six months ago
another brand success story in the quarter has been woods last year we did a nineteen store test of woods outerwear at sport chek this year we came back aggressively
i'm not at all concerned about the brand we're down to -- i think the brand's in really really good shape and i think susan and tj would agree that it's less about how the brand is going to be positioned in canada
it sounds as though we won't really see much of a change in the in-store offering here in canada until later in twenty nineteen and really we should be looking to 'twenty and 'twenty one in terms of how it builds is that fair
reported revenue and the proxy for the dealer shipments was up ten percent right so how do we think about that in terms of what happened last year and how to think as we progress through the fourth quarter
and again we're just -- we're just not seeing any indicators that there's any softening based on kind of those three big looks into the business
and also for two thousand and nineteen we today announced a double-digit increase in our dividend and the continuation of our share repurchase program signaling our confidence in the company's future
you will see us work to increase that proactively going into 'nineteen this is one of the key things that allan and tj have diagnosed as a big opportunity for fgl heading into next year
yes i mean i obviously want to see ebitda margin expansion as time goes on and i think the next phase of the productivity program is really focused on our cost structure
we've been reviving existing brands like noma motomaster and outbound these three brands have been rejuvenated over the past two years
clearly the work to reposition mark's brand with well worn along with the work pj has done on assortment and merchandising has made a significant impact
so that's why we've made woods and other own brands a priority for chek this season over the coming weeks we'll execute a plan to re-merchandise our athletic and outerwear departments by category instead of by brand as they are today
we also adjusted the ifrs nine model allowance compared to our original assumptions given the portfolio's good performance in terms of risk
snowing virtually everywhere in central canada so i think the commentary we provided at the time is that we saw real strong shipments in the december time frame and if you remember coming out of q one that was one of the big
this new manufacturing facility further solidifies our foothold in south america construction on this facility was completed in the second quarter of twenty eighteen in australia
for twenty six consecutive years and we're very proud of our track record of annual dividend increases
design and engineering for the project is currently underway with construction expected to begin in the spring of twenty nineteen the project is one of the largest accommodation facilities ever built in canada
overall atco had a very busy year as we continue to transform into a globally diversified infrastructure holding company
funds generated by operations and capital investment these measures do not have any standardized meaning under ifrs and as a result they may not be comparable to similar measures presented in other entities
we also signed a contract for workforce housing and operational support services for three camps
about seventy percent of our outflows from sipp on wrap for instance goes back to the customer in terms of regular income
in summary we're operating two successful and growing businesses and our management teams are executing on their operating plans
expert real estate evaluations of our future disposition of these properties along with accounting for our experiencing and exiting our first thirty five retail outlets
as well as excluding certain recurring and nonrecurring adjustments for comparable gaap measures investors have an additional meaningful measurement of the company's performance
we also benefited from the investment and efficiency efforts of the past eighteen months which includes inventory freight
it should allow us to expand our mro and consumable products business and is a good example of the expert knowledge and enhanced services we are bringing to our customers
thank you larry i will address our segment financial performance in more detail as mentioned previously my comments will be primarily directed to non-gaap results
the five basis points of nim improvement over the third quarter was driven by a combination of benefits from higher short-term interest rates and favorable funding mix offset by an increase in cost of interest-bearing deposits
some corporate and non-bq-related issuance and underwriting and so while you have seen other institutions in fact some of the largest banks in the country report
we've started to look at the next group which we call seven k inside of our company but the really heavy lifting is mostly behind us so i don't think you should
information about factors that may cause them to differ is contained in our sec filings forward-looking statements made speak only as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them except to the extent required by securities laws
compared to the fourth quarter of two thousand sixteen margin expanded twenty one basis points approximately ten basis points of this expansion was driven by the benefit that our free funds provide in a rising rate environment
the composition of our loan book and regional view are shown on slides thirty three and thirty four and we are seeing positive trends in several of our markets and verticals most notably commercial real estate and construction and our national lending platforms
okay so we should see like when we look at sort of going out in two q versus one q outside of any investments we should expect that number to further drop down into the second quarter
pretty dramatic increases in that what has helped us and offset some of that decline on the bq side has been the move into corporates which has been a successful launch for us
particularly in our traditional forty act business we are also redoubling our investments in the faster growing segments and areas of strategic focus including exchange traded funds private equity and alternative investment businesses
finally you'll see the details for the bank and asset servicing segments beginning on slide twenty six followed by details on each
from a vertical perspective within our lending area however just because of the scale of the opportunities on the cre side it's likely that they continue to have a little bit of an outside
investments will serve to improve the digital user experience for our partners and customers as well as expand our hsa investment capabilities
while tax reform is seen as a positive we don't expect it to significantly affect cre development or acquisition activity
which became effective october three at this stage it's too early to evaluate the rule's ultimate impact
we think that that will continue to be -- continue to show weakness going into 'sixteen but i should point out that is not a significant part of our commercial business
and then the cash flow impact could you give us an update on what you would anticipate for twenty sixteen the reduced cash payments for losses what does that mean for your free cash flow
with a long history of exceptional performance in the nicu the integrated system as well as our industry-leading comprehensive service model
in the coming months we will continue to work with the primary investigators and the fda to clarify a potential path forward
a portion of the trial and now fifty percent fifty percent data confirming what we saw in the first quarter that information is intriguing to payers and to prescribers as well
but we think that the feedback that we're getting from customers is that inomax offering is something that offers a lot of value to them in this particularly fragile patient population
so this is the product the physicians go to manage these critical patients whose median survival is in the range of two to four weeks when they actually are experiencing this exacerbation of their condition
at inomax growth continues to be driven by strong demand and contract renewals at or above historic levels
we expect a better understanding of the potential benefit of vts-two seventy to emerge as we carefully consider the totality of data available to us this is an important step
as i mentioned last quarter given the rmat designation awarded to this program we will continue to engage with the fda to evaluate an earlier submission if the data are supportive
potentially be able to file this in twenty nineteen or do you think you might have to do some more
also have -- helps to answer an additional question which is is there additional benefit that accrues by keeping the patients on for another twelve weeks
but that was set up for the early two thousand and twenty s knowing that we've got a number of products to launch in the next
you would be account by account and one of the things that we think is a strength of the inomax offering
the geopolitical tensions and this increasing us dollar are all bad macro forces for us in that sense in terms of what we're facing
for more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in the documents we file from time to time with the sec including our most recently
so looking ahead i'm excited about the opportunity at smart to further leverage on a strong execution capability that is demonstrated so well
i will now provide additional detail for our three operating segments including our domestic agriculture and construction segments and our international segment
or sixty seven percent improvement in adjusted pretax results on a consolidated basis
today's conference is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the conference over to mr john mills with icr please go ahead
for the first quarter of fiscal two thousand and nineteen on slide ten you will see the progress we have made in our expense structure and corresponding improvement in our absorption rate over the same period
as of april thirty two thousand eighteen we continue to have ample capacity in our credit lines to handle our equipment finance needs
slide twelve provides an overview of our cash flows from operating activities
as i discussed earlier we did accelerate some of our new equipment purchases into the first quarter of fiscal 'nineteen due to the increased lead times and potential steel surcharges
you'll see on slide two of the presentation our safe harbor statement we would like to remind everyone that the prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements and management may make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions
excluding the incremental inventory associated with our agram acquisition in germany
revenue was negatively impacted by a lower store count resulting from our fiscal two thousand eighteen restructuring plan
you will note that there are no adjustments to our current quarter gaap reported amounts as all activities associated with our fiscal two thousand eighteen restructuring plan
we have reduced our annual operating expenses from fiscal two thousand fourteen to
we'll provide updates on our business review as well as the status of our attempts at resolution with the pbgc to enable us to operate and grow our business in the most efficient and profitable way possible
once again these results underscore the demand for an opioid-sparing solution like exparel and our team's success in decreasing the number of patients who are exposed to the risk of the operating room as a gateway to opioid misuse and abuse
specifically many anesthesiologists are viewing exparel as a game changer and the positive results that they are achieving with brachial plexus blocks
once the final cms rule on j code take effect on january one we will expect smoother reimbursement to begin to unfold for both medicare and commercial payers as the market standardizes around the medicare reimbursement j code
so the high level of interest among anesthesiologists is not surprising with clinicians very eager for pediatric patients to be included in the exparel label to that end
a lot of what's being done between the two organizations is being driven by
symphony health for a long time kind of correlated with exparel and then
and then when you take that away you have a very different scenario so if you looked at it over the last two years when there was no payment
so that we can be ready to go on january one and the biggest single thing is that we don't want to tell people that something is possible and then have them billed for it and have all those bills rejected that's what we're trying to avoid
in addition to the ambulatory setting our outpatient account managers are successfully engaging with oral surgery and plastic surgery customers who are interested in highlighting their use of exparel as a means of differentiating their practice
this is a key advantage as the literature indicates that performing hip fracture surgery within twenty four hours of injury is associated with better functional outcomes along with lower complications and mortality
a description of these metrics along with our reconciliation to gaap can be found in this morning's press release
looking ahead to our full year financial guidance in addition to increasing our exparel sales guidance
so many of the big payers would tell you that they believe that they pay for exparel today
and so i think we have every reason to believe that when you marry that with the d code that we will see
so we see it -- we've had some very interesting discussions some just in the last twenty four hours
relative to the last year that there was a payment you would see that -- you would come to a very different conclusion that if you took a five-year moving averages which is the way that cms approached it so i think whether they're going to
we continue to hear exparel success stories from physicians who are using an opioid-minimization strategy as a catalyst to shift both large and small procedures to the ambulatory setting
we see an expanding role for exparel in oral surgery field where an overwhelming majority of patients would prefer a nonopioid option for managing pain
the problem is that because we don't have a j code and the sop for how the providers are billing the payers
to standardize their ability to bill for exparel across the continuum way more than medicare so in terms of a qualitative impact of that change
and so we think that having the ability to bill for exparel even in an environment where it is currently the standard of care is going to really accelerate
with big ambulatory groups who want to start using exparel very aggressively to drive their -- the momentum of their business around the fact that it will be reimbursed
and so they're all slightly different in terms of how they got to where they are with exparel and so we're learning how to address these folks individually as customers
many of these younger patients are exposed to opioids for the first time following common procedures like wisdom tooth extractions improving access to opioid-free solutions like exparel is critical in this vulnerable population
who order on a regular basis and so part of the reason we put the twenty four folks out there was specifically to allow folks that have a retail focus
and you see the halo of that that people that have had success with exparel in the ambulatory environment especially people who are
so we've had i think a cordial discussion on the fact that a five-year average is probably not a great way to look at this that if you looked at it in the context of the first three years when we had a c code
ordering exparel been increasing it or is it now about further penetrating existing accounts in the hospital setting
approximately fifty percent of the operating systems will be handed over to the owner by the end of this year
the first nations will take ownership in a world-class terminal asset which is expected to generate solid returns for the next fifty years or more
and commercial markets through our participation in early april at the defexpo eighteen india show our superior microdisplay performance was of great interest
as noted on page nineteen of the supplemental information we currently have eleven new facilities under active construction and development that along with
will be a net positive for healthsouth it's important to remember there are two goals of these alternative models
and finally our partner encompass has established a very solid track record of treating complex patients in their homes through their specialty programs two of which focus on cardiac
up thirty basis points from q two 'fifteen as can be seen on slide eighteen the rate of new prepayment claims denials declined from the level we had experienced in the three preceding quarters
the higher percentage of patients requiring therapy visits had a favorable impact on q two pricing
has led us to estimate the impact to healthsouth as a reimbursement reduction of three percent to four percent this updated estimate may be found on slide twenty of the supplemental materials
hell bent on rolling this out across all three states that we're affected in no matter what that first rollout looks like we really do think that there are going to be a lot of providers who are not up for
all of those costs then are included in that ninety-day episode so that's why we've been saying for so many years
which is the request for advance payment and that's where we actually get paid about sixty percent from medicare at the beginning of the episode
the company does not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements our supplemental information and discussion on this call will include certain non-gaap financial measures
we believe we can continue to enhance the clinical collaboration between our two segments thereby continuing to increase the number of patients cared for by encompass agencies over time
our inpatient clinical information system has been installed at six former reliant hospitals and will be installed in all former reliant hospitals by year-end
the opening of this new hospital will depend on when we receive the final con
first in many of our markets our hospitals are the ninety-day low-cost provider for the hip conditions included in these bundling initiatives and we believe we can exploit this advantage to gain market share
we have also analyzed the new bundle model and believe the downside risk of these two are modest
this is larger than previously anticipated owing to two provisions within the proposed rule
strength in your medicare advantage business inside the irf and i'm going to ask this question in the context of transformation of payer and
great and just to ask the requisite stupid question on the call could you just explain a little more what the significance of the ninety-day
we believe that ultimately the works that we do on that initiative will allow us to develop commercial bundled payment products that can be marketed to ma plans and other payers
for such measures reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measure is available at the end of the supplemental information
on page twenty six of the supplemental information you will note the overall payer mix of our discharges has stabilized and is generally in line with the payer mix we've had over the last three quarters
additionally on july twenty we announced the closure of our legacy hospital in downtown austin and its consolidation with one of the two former reliant hospitals in that market
encompass also added to its portfolio in the quarter with the acquisition of two home health and two hospice agencies in the greater atlanta market and the opening of one home health agency in the new port richey florida market
the second is to reduce medicare spending for beneficiary importantly this second objective is measured over a ninety-day episode
as a reminder this proposal is nine hundred-plus pages and was published just this week so our analysis is preliminary at this point
and the expenses related to the integration of caresouth as may be seen on slide seventeen and as jay discussed
and the updated considerations related to this guidance are included on slide fourteen i'd like to spend a few moments and elaborate on some of the items we expect to impact our performance in the second half of the year
here on the administrative side and also some potential increases in dso and maybe even bad debt expense for a period of time as we transition to this new provision we think that that will be temporary
the potential impact of the cardiac portion of this new model is harder to size because cms has not disclosed the ninety eight markets that will be randomly chosen to participate
revenue per episode for the second quarter declined by one point six percent largely owing to the medicare rate cuts that became effective at the beginning of the year
bryan and modesto together with the impact of converting midland to a jv will create a net expense
waiting in line for the medicare contractor to give them permission to treat the patient so it's the lesser of two evils
so aj it's doug i think that you're looking at it the right way in terms of the pricing impact
and by far the largest national distributor for specialty construction projects serving fourteen trades we have a unique understanding of our customers' needs
we've been dealing with increasing cost in steel rebar since tariffs were first introduced in twenty seventeen we've been successful in passing along all of the cost increases
yes look we certainly expect to grow the business profitably and when we say grow the business profitably that means to continually expand our ebitda margins
we listened intently to the voice of our customer regularly releasing improvements to our website to become even easier to do business with twenty eighteen also saw the release of our new sales console
as the weather improves and we have the opportunity to deliver to job sites our sales performance will normalize we remain confident on delivering a strong twenty nineteen next is the construction end markets
for the full year of fiscal twenty eighteen we estimate our ongoing annual capital expenditure requirements to be approximately two percent of annual sales
also during the fourth quarter of fiscal twenty eighteen we experienced a holiday calendar shift whereby christmas eve and new year's eve fell on a monday
we believe we have now established that the control of il-one two is a potential therapeutic platform for turning cold tumors hot
as well business and financial meetings has increased substantially in two thousand eighteen already and with global reach
we have recently seen a very strong trend with major partnerships and acquisitions in this area and we believe that controlled il-one two is now positioned
i want to reiterate that all of our work at md anderson is already paid for
as we have progressed and learned over the last few months in particular we are certainly smarter and better positioned for value creation for example we saw great maturation in our clinical data in our il-one two gbm patients
with the prepayments that we will draw down over time in fact this covers us for all of the cost of work planned at md anderson for the next two years
and we've developed a new business model for hospitals ziopharm will provide patients and caregivers with a solution that addresses the cost and complexity
without control you cannot safely harness the benefit of il-one two indeed we can directly see from our clinical data that the tumor tries to defend itself from this invading army of t cells with an upregulation of checkpoint
we have shown already in three types of cancer that the controlled il-one two is a powerful platform that can turn cold tumors hot in other words
particularly in the second half of two thousand seventeen which furthered our understanding as to why patients could benefit from the control of this master immune regulator
and the scalability essentially of car-t we know hospitals and providers have significant concerns about the payment models and the total cost associated with currently approved t-cell therapies
on the other side with the il-one two the rates were in there is that we know for some cancers you don't know the targets
perfect then talking about the car-ts and i know you take a lot of pride in how you have improved the manufacturing processes
hopefully throughout the course of this call today as you listen to our full year twenty eighteen results and recent corporate updates
in twenty nineteen again based on what we are seeing thus far into the first quarter of this year we are highly confident in achieving our full year guidance
we've already made great strides in just the first few months of the year with our data presentations at the world symposium on orlando
the reach and breadth of our footprint is remarkable when you think that just a few short years ago in two thousand and fifteen amicus in total had fewer than two hundred employees operating out of our one location here in new jersey
you provided some nice color on the trends you're seeing with the galafold launch in us and europe maybe you can just make a few comments on what you're seeing in japan and maybe how that compares to us and europe thanks
and the ongoing propelled pivotal study support our strategy to advance at-gaa as quickly as possible with the potential to become the new standard of care for people living with pompe disease
in addition to the announcement of the breakthrough therapy designation for the remainder of this year we will concentrate on the propel study enrollment
to people who in too many cases particularly children living with these diseases believe that they no longer have hope up to ten thousand children that we estimate are living
then we took the decision to commercialize galafold on our own and have now built an organization of more than six hundred total global employees
the second aspect i'd like to highlight on slide twenty one is the tremendous team of entrepreneurs that brings the utmost passion for patients and for our mission to bring great new medicines to people living with rare diseases
sure so -- the one part of amicus that we -- that has maintained a pretty steady state over the last four years of our growth has been our science organization
we also expect this year to complete enrollment in the pivotal study which we're calling the propel study
the initial child with clm three batten disease in that study continues to participate with no serious adverse events
in addition to the more frequent and intense dialog with the fda on this program and also all of the initiatives that may advance this medicine to pompe patients as quickly as possible
as we shift into our financial results and outlook i'd like to draw your attention to slide four to note the highlights that i first outlined in early january
and we remain very confident that this strength will continue in twenty nineteen during our first full year of launch in these major markets and also as we enter new markets around the world
so with that turning to slide twenty let me first emphasize that we are a global organization with a presence now in all four major regions around the world including a presence in twenty seven countries
getting that science ready for manufacturer and ultimately then hand of either to a cmo or to our later stage process development
at-gaa to have a pretty profound effect on their function and we saw that also in the motor function of course in the six-minute walk increasing in both groups so
and that this team knows how to manage in a way to access that value keep our trucks moving and grow our logistics business further and let's not forget this assembled management team has only been together for two full quarters
my greatest concern is which usa truck will show up in the middle innings of this mighty change we are proud of our results for sure but it is our job as a team to make sure that these greatly improved results become the new standard of our business
over prior first quarters of past years as i said before our intent is to measure our performance against the industry and close the performance gap in meaningful ways like it's never been done at usa truck before
i think we can have a debate about what industry averages over the long term but yes i think in nineteen twenties -- i think pretty consistent with what we think so
unlike many of our competitors we did a pay increase in the fourth quarter of 'sixteen prior to that we also
as the market is changing our customers are also changing their bid sequence i mean one very large customer that most people know has pulled their bid in and made it a one-year bid for all of their business that's going through right now
there is also an important network effect so i literally had a conversation with my pricing team two weeks ago
i mean what we have said very consistently is we think it takes our team two full bid cycles to make this our network and so we are just now implementing
and such statements are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections and are made pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of nineteen ninety five as amended
we did ramp the new partners in the fourth quarter and have just begun seeing the impact of those efforts in the last three weeks
i'm not sure we're two-zero but we are showing our ability to close the gap with our public competitors like never before
at a ratio of one-for-seven effective as of the opening of trading
in the first nine months of two thousand and seventeen we have nearly achieved those results and anticipate
break out what percentage of your ems sales are driven by that market in particular
in ems and now you're at forty one percent this quarter so i'm trying to get a feel for what to expect going forward do you see this level sustainable or was there anything in it that might have caused it to be a little bit higher than what it normally should be
good morning and welcome to the american airlines group third quarter twenty seventeen earnings call
on previous earnings calls i provided estimates for our twenty eighteen pension contributions as the airline relief legislation ends for us
the early results are encouraging as nearly twenty percent of customers notified of early or delayed bags are using customer bag notification to set up a bag delivery
can you talk about your revenue outlook by region underlying your healthy four q outlook
so in conclusion despite the challenges resulting from the three hurricanes our team has produced another excellent quarter
bouncing back from a difficult summer of twenty sixteen in addition our baggage performance continues to be a focus for our team
about ninety percent of other revenue next year will be the loyalty revenue that goes through other so is there a plan to either rename or break out that line next year why would you continue to call it other when that's not really what it will be
we will continue to take a measured approach to matching our planned capacity levels with anticipated levels of demand we are still in the process of developing our operating plan for twenty eighteen so
we're already on our way with a full launch of basic economy across our domestic system on september five our careful planning and measured rollout over the summer has resulted in a very successful launch with no disruption
performance has been in line with expectations with about fifty percent of customers who received a basic offer choosing to buy up to the main cabin product
but we can also be leaders in making it better so if the naacp wants to talk to us and wants to help us get better we're excited about that so
from plus fifty to plus twenty five to fifty on a full year basis but you talked a lot about mix i was hoping you could tell us a little bit more
a replay of the conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call until friday may ten twenty nineteen instructions for accessing this replay are included in our first quarter twenty nineteen earnings press release
what we did see is relative to your pull-in question or what we saw is we definitely -- i think we highlighted this in february that we thought there was somewhere around seventy to a hundred basis points
and for the last twenty five years leading it to becoming one of the most important restaurant brands of our time i thank steve for the invaluable time he's spent bringing me up to speed over the past several weeks and i deeply appreciate him fully handing over the reins to me and giving me the autonomy to lead
catering is approximately one percent of sales and remains a large untapped opportunity on which we have increased our focus
check average also benefited from customers adding queso to their order which added about two hundred bps april trends have been impacted by unseasonably cold and wintry weather in much of the country as well as the easter shift
we still anticipate marketing and promo costs to be right around three percent of sales for the full year with elevated spending for the remainder of the year
it doesn't have the ability to handle new menu news or even use price because of that simple menu and those are two tools that you used with great effect in the past and so i think people are having a hard time understanding
the quiet period will begin on the sixteenth day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call
and most importantly for all patients so regardless of patient or cancer type we have we believe the best means to choose neoantigens our atlas technology
atlas found many other neoantigens that were not predicted and importantly also showed that some antigens were inhibitory potentially shutting off a patient's immune response
as we mentioned in today's press release we'll be presenting some compelling new atlas data at next week's sitc meeting
about how the immune system will respond to different potential antigens but the evidence is that these in silico tools only have a twenty percent to thirty percent predictive power
we will also continue to follow the clinical outcomes of patients in the trial as i mentioned we anticipate an ind early next year
and of course we continue to look as we said at gen-oh oh three partnership opportunities we see a couple of different ways that we can be bringing in nondilutive capital
so what makes us different it's our core technology atlas which is our proprietary neoantigen identification platform
we'll identify the unique mutations in each patient's tumor and will then feed all of those potential candidate neoantigens into atlas
and it's that platform plus gen-oh oh nine and the products that we generate from it that create nondilutive financing opportunities with which we can advance the company
we expect it will last around thirty minutes and we'll provide you will both a qualitative and quantitative summary of the most significant events in the period plus an outlook of our expectations and estimates for this year
argentina area keeps on growing organically at thirty six percent as we continue passing inflation cost to prices in the country with no deterioration
times to drill each wells are beginning to shorten with one well being delivered in a record sixteen days from spuds to total depth
the combination of these factors together with a large selloff in the equity markets due to concerns around global growth and increasing us interest rates
we could be facing a more moderate growth in us shale production in the coming years than what the most optimistic views have been suggesting
of twenty seventeen now unfortunately we have not yet been able to obtain the needed regulatory approval from the russian authorities so
might not necessarily make the headline but significant ones count on one in 'nineteen and one in 'twenty some of that is related to where we are in the value generation in the field
and i think we're starting to see opportunities around the world to now continue to have those discussions as we go into two oh one nine and i
now for q one of 'nineteen we expect to be in the low end of this range now we're going to have the normal impact of winter
how does that change going forward how does the industry -- and you're the leader in the industry how does the industry finally get to a point where they can earn their cost of capital at some point other than the peak of the seven-year cycle
first of all the internet business acquired three point two million giga subscribers as of the end of the second quarter
moving on to my question then i would like to ask the management of kt what is your priority across shareholders government and employees
we asked this question to your other competitors as well i would like to understand what kt's position is with respect
continuing the top line growth for eight consecutive quarters since the second quarter of twenty fifteen when giga internet subscriber acquisition actually took off
one update is that we continue negotiations with major national retailers for the remaining target space and while the replacement of the income at the three properties vacated by target takes time we are making solid progress
and building a better reit also speaks to the ongoing focus to make our business better every day by working tirelessly to execute our strategy
and your rent spreads on renewals have been fairly strong for a while now so i assume that speaks to not only anchors but also some of the cru tenants around them as well a
we hope to have more details to share by the end of q two but progress is in hand our commitment to doing the right real estate deal for the long term at both of these locations will pay off as they are strong assets in their respective in north bay markets
location so we are going to probably transition through a little bit of vacancy there over the next year or two where we end up having to move people around but i think at the end of the day it will be a much stronger
that are in front of us q one was a quiet but steady quarter in terms of completed acquisitions and dispositions but with much work completed on pending transactions
when we bought it they had about eight years left on their lease but again working closely with them we're hopeful that we can do something in the very short term
and the success of other -- of our strategic initiatives and on slide seven you're going to see that we've been doing just that
we've already launched four g in switzerland and the netherlands and we've seen a rapid increase in sales and revenue activity in both those markets maybe just a quick comment on mobile consolidation
which has a direct impact in terms of cost reduction and margin improvement for us and is real money so we don't have to pay our mno partner
not because of all the acquisitions that have taken place over the last five years it really is just as simple as rethinking how we do things and how we operate our business and when you combine the high single-digit rebased growth
so before i turn over to bernie i'll come back to my key themes it's all about growth for us customers arpus revenue and ocf and while we feel
however we are delivering on the ziggo synergy plan which we expect to have a favorable impact on ocf performance
on slide fourteen we present a summary of the year-to-date results of the lilac group which is comprised of our operations in latin america and the caribbean
i could theoretically end the call right there and go to questions but i promised the team i'd walk through the rest of the slides so bear with us and i'm going to move to slide five now which summarizes
part of it is just where we are in the cycle and i think that we think the opportunity in the next three years in that market certainly looks better than the last three years
wherever they are and then i'll wrap up my remarks on page nine with some operational developments that have a direct impact on growth for us and i'll start with just a bit more color on liberty threeoh and i said before
on slide twelve we break out our third quarter rebased revenue and ocf growth rates for our operations in western europe which make up over ninety percent of our total european revenue
we are running our fall campaigns and now we're in the middle of our best selling season and we are targeting up to one million rgu additions for the full year
that is going to be the engine of growth for us in the b two b space so we have to invest in products we have to invest in people
and i'll talk about our advanced video platforms in a second but when you consider that our next-gen video services and tv everywhere products consist of very fat content offers
with twenty sixteen growth forecast in the high one s to low two s with the heavy majority of this new supply coming from the largest vessel segments
whilst gsl is fully independent from cma cgm we maintain a strong working and strategic relationship with them
the expectation that demand growth will outgrow supply growth this year and potentially also in twenty seventeen is certainly a step in the right direction
this brings us to slide ten where you can see that scrapping activity is indeed on the rise
contracting has continued to slow materially during twenty sixteen new orders placed during the first nine months of the year
you'll also see in the two horizontal red boxes the extension periods that we secured
for the two vessels previously coming off charter at the end of next year
good afternoon and welcome to the second quarter twenty sixteen earnings discussion for pennymac mortgage investment trust
during the second quarter uncertainty in global financial markets led investors into the relative safety of us treasuries sending interest rates lower
offered through the home affordable modification program commonly referred to as hamp in addition to proprietary modification programs to help more borrowers qualify for a modification
the bottom table provides information related to the current balance of our crt investments
cash flows from pmt's existing investment portfolio remain strong
this slide illustrates how the crt transactions are carried on the balance sheet and flow through the income statement
which are made possible through pfsi's specialized capabilities as our manager and service provider in addition to investments in small balance multifamily loans
investment opportunities now let's turn to slide eight and discuss the second quarter's results by strategy
returns on correspondent production improved to a sixty three percent pretax annualized return on equity as a result of increased locks
with distressed whole loans decreasing over time and crt investments increasing
in our evaluation of the earnings potential for pmt and determining
that can have quite a meaningful impact on many banks as they are required to look forward over a twelve-month period or even as far as the remaining life of their exposures in
so let me close my remarks by verifying that i remain confident about the prospects for bladex in twenty sixteen as the bank capitalizes on its position as a relevant player in the region with an important role
so thanks for trusting us i look forward to talking to you for the first quarter of two thousand and sixteen when we meet again in april have a good day
comparing with q one's for the cost without the blackout in accident and the earthquake and the last
report on the complete tv set in terms of its progress and development
on the second quarter of twenty seventeen before we begin allow me to introduce the speakers today
usually for the preorders so we believe the stock level is still reasonable since q three is usually a high season for ordering
these newly connected ipass users collected over five million network records in the rio area
one interesting point on that partner they had annual shortfall revenue in q two 'sixteen but are now actively ramping and they have doubled their consumption of hours in october over september
up from fifty percent last quarter and giving us increased flexibility in pricing and winning significant strategic partner opportunities
with the goal of course of trying to drive similar growth in acv some deals are big
around how we're buying gogo going forward so we can do a little more interesting stuff with our unlimited customers and providing them access to that gogo footprint at a reasonable price
yes absolutely so historically we've defined acv as it has to be incremental to run rate revenue if it's a existing customer signing a commitment
potentially requiring some technology customization as we've expanded our reach and introduced the sdk the number of whales in our ocean is expanding making us less dependent on any single partnership
by now you're probably sick of hearing me say that the size of our network has more than tripled from just one year ago
we can now process an incredible one billion records per hour literally orders of magnitude faster than where we were in september
we calculate the last full quarter of run rate revenue and annualize to determine the adverse impact on revenue over the next twelve months
related to the end of the modification periods for executives terminated in the two thousand and fifteen restructuring event most modification periods have now expired and we expect exercises will decline significantly in the fourth quarter
while this growth was modest it's good to have two in a row and three in a row makes a trend
in short we continue to extend ipass everywhere with focus on making sure everyone is able to connect in the places they need to be
and in the pursuit of this goal our largest and most important partners have told us that our ipass smartconnect technology has a twelve- to eighteen-month lead over any competition
and third we enjoy a customer and partner base approaching one thousand organizations among them some of the world's largest and most respected brands
and i've assured my husband there will be no round three but i'm fully committed to making a seamless and successful transition with debra over the next few months
debra and i have worked closely over the past two years and i am confident that debra will successfully build upon the strong foundation for our businesses that we have formed together following the lorillard acquisition
offset by the impact from the removal of camel styles associated with the fda's not substantially equivalent decision in the fourth quarter of last year
this compares to industry inventories of seven point six billion units at the end of the third quarter last year which remained stable over the course of that quarter
but certainly the deeming kind of news coming out in may and then really the ninety days to get anything into the market certainly drove a lot of investment in this quarter
mean it's been more than eighteen months that we've seen very very favorable and even improving trends i would say and now what i think you have is a little more stagnating trends
and i'd remind you here of our significant debt reduction two dividend increases and rai's new share repurchase program so i'm very pleased with the way this year has progressed
it has been a true pleasure over the past two years working with our talented team gaining a deep understanding of the tobacco industry as well as directly contributing to the success of our strong businesses and powerful brands
newport's volume in the third quarter was up about one percent versus the prior year and was not significantly impacted by wholesale inventory changes
please refer to schedules two and three at the end of our earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results
rj reynolds' strong margin improvement in the quarter was largely driven by the net pricing
for the entire time that we were making product for itg so when you go through the calculated net price realization that is something that we wanted to provide some color on because i think
there was in rjrt in three q relative to the margin that you achieved in two q and i was wondering if you could just talk about
not only is this the right time for a transition to new roles but debra is absolutely the right person to lead rai and its companies to the next level
as you know the brand rolled out a ten-count mini lozenge in selected stores in the third quarter and this style is now available
reynolds american had a very successful first nine months of the year with strong financial performance across each of its operating companies along with the successful completion of our integration process
american snuff reported another good quarter with volume growth of over two percent and net pricing realization
which was paid on october three this quarter's dividend increase follows the sixteen point seven percent increase announced in february and is the third dividend increase since we completed the lorillard acquisition last june
and our state political process engagement were two incremental
joe also comes to rj reynolds with a strong track record of bringing brand innovations to market which will serve the company well moving forward
vibe offers more liquid than the brand's previous products and also has a more powerful and longer-lasting battery
in about nineteen thousand outlets so that's a quick look at our operating company's achievements in the latest quarter and over the first nine months of the year
to-ebitda i would note here that given the relatively low interest rate outlook along with our improving interest coverage
the energy coal market has rebounded from the lows at the start of twenty sixteen and the direct benefit of the recent increase in prices has been most clearly felt in indonesia followed also by the australian suppliers and miners
as always the full financial statements and long form management discussion and analysis are available on our website and at the sgx website i recommend that you read them in conjunction with this presentation
with expectations in the first half of twenty sixteen as confirmed by the group's back-testing activities
i'd like to take this opportunity to state that our focus has been on liquidity and the following actions have already been undertaken in the last six months
we continue to see growth opportunities across the barrel and around the world the growth of our us natural gas export capacity is expected to provide further opportunities
in total the actions that have already undertaken in the last six months are expected to improve our pbit performance
strong global oil demand growth and us product exports will continue to give us opportunities in our central and south american franchises
in the oil liquids business in all regions and in the lng business
on a comparative basis as a percentage of revenue i do think that that is one point that you should take into consideration between the two companies there is a difference
while we had a positive comp it is important to note that our product mix was substantially different than it was in q three of last year
as we mentioned in q two we reviewed each store to ensure we had quality team members who are knowledgeable about flooring and available to serve our customers
and our projections of pretax income for the remainder of two thousand and sixteen we expect that our tax rate in the near term will continue to be impacted by valuation allowance and deferred tax considerations
there's been a lot of noise in it over the last say one year one and a half years if you think about the interruption we've had in several of our assortments so we're kind of seeing that return to normal if you will
feel those two teams are working together and that may have an impact on where you see us source from in the future but
how we talk to the customers about it i think probably over the course of the next quarter or two we'll really start to understand where we think that's going to land as a percent of penetration of our total business
by the end of two thousand sixteen we will have replaced over half of our product with a fresh contemporary line most of this assortment is in our stores today and customer feedback has been very positive
our team is focused and determined to execute on those opportunities as we look ahead to two thousand seventeen now let me hand it over to marty to walk you through the numbers in more detail
with no likely requirement for an advisory committee meeting and with a pdufa date in the third quarter of this year
and so we set the stage for an exciting twenty seventeen which i will come to in a moment but before i do i'll turn it over to bill
we expect simultaneous publication of fourier in a leading medical journal with supplementary materials
and its potential treatment fifty four thousand patients with the data to review in a few hours is substantial and i think will give us some clues about the future
we admiringly and respectfully refer to this project as cubist two the project is well underway and we continue to evaluate all of our strategic options for this remarkable set of important id assets and capabilities
yes we still like the look of the data in that regard and we'll present the information in detail on the seventeenth but yes that's still a very much in the
it's three weeks way presentations and discussions at the meeting are likely to tilt the whole direction of dyslipidemia management worldwide for many years to come
yes we're currently trying to figure out a way to do a nine-day week
added to the overall result for the quarter and for the continued momentum through nine months and when you look back over the last four years you see the consistency of results and continuation of improvement in the underwriting
these returns will be lumpy and the results through the first nine months of the year is more than we would expect in a normal annual period
before going through each segment let me say again for the second quarter in a row that our us business in total is doing very well
well i think if you go back and read our transcripts for the last ten quarters we've been saying the same thing having said that
of course the corresponding loss ratio is in the twenties or thirties the same is true of some of our risk-managed business within commercial specialty
in fact this quarter's us underwriting income was one of the best in the history of the company now let me briefly comment on each of our operating segments
this growth was somewhat offset by lower premium in argo reit due to increased competition having said that we do see some signs that the market is bottoming
which pay fees in excess of our firm average and one less day in the quarter
page eleven of the earnings presentation displays net flows by investment vehicle
displays the current and trailing four quarter trend in revenue and breaks out investment advisory fees by vehicle
also the presentation we make today contains pro forma or non-gaap financial measures which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the company's performance
of course our ultimate goal is to achieve net inflows in all four of these segments simultaneously
it in terms of eps it was also a good quarter
but you need to bear in mind that last year recurring was strong in q four because we had a few catch-ups
we have provided supplemental non-ifrs financial information for understanding of the differences between the two please see the reconciliation tables included in our press release
and these investments really began to pay off last year as we delivered seven percent organic sales growth
moving to our cash flow in two thousand seventeen we generated strong free cash flow which enabled us to repurchase two million shares of common stock
and finally our success rate or hit rate if you will on opportunities is up nearly twenty five percent so we've never been in better position to realize that sales growth
or bring us new presences in geographies like iqap i'll have some additional comments in a moment but to review some additional details about the fourth quarter let me now turn the call over to brad
this was driven by organic sales growth of five percent and the benefit of acquisitions which were partially offset by higher raw material cost
okay and i believe you mentioned that polyone experienced strong growth in asia have you seen any changes in industry competitive dynamics in china and asia more broadly in the past six months or so and
revenue for the fourth quarter increased fifteen percent our highest quarterly increase of the year
due to the underperformance of dss before i hand the call back to bob i'd like to briefly discuss our thoughts on tax reform
as a portion of our foreign earnings will be subject to us taxes on an ongoing basis and certain deductions will be reduced or eliminated
we have a robust pipeline of innovative composite materials to serve these and other markets and estimate more than fifty percent revenue growth from composites in the next five years as these materials make their way to market
that's probably the best thing that i can say or the most accurate thing i can say about the competitive environment as i said the most challenging being in em still
i think it was a very good end of the year where we had a little bit of both where we saw some mix and price improvement on top of about four percent volume growth so i think a good quarter all the way around in that regard
can you provide i guess a little more detail on why margins in asia could remain lower than the other regions yes i'm not sure i would point to anything specifically in the last six months
even with our record sales performance in two thousand seventeen two thousand seventeen was admittedly a difficult year for engineered materials and the industry as a whole as we were challenged with raw material pricing pressures
negatively impacted q four but all things considered we delivered another strong performance and one that we expect to build upon
in terms of additional costs that are going into the business the only observation that i have about m
we are encouraged by our growing sale of ufs controller to micron in the second quarter
to give you more detail on this restatement we use an internally derived standard currency exchange rate for our constant currency sales and reporting segment results this standard fx approach is designed to give a more consistent long-term view of results
the only other things that i'd point out a large number of abstracts from our ep group looking at some of the newer
which was higher than our guidance of seventy basis points as a result of over-performance of the pathology business
we believe we are on track to reenter the european market and submit our us pma in the fourth quarter of this year
given the recent periods of volatile exchange rate fluctuations we've seen larger differences between these internal standard FX rates and the actual foreign exchange rates as a result we updated our internally derived standard currency exchange rates
in synergy manufacturing equipment due to higher volumes as well as campus consolidation and plant network optimization activities
finally we adjusted eps to exclude transaction cost related to the acquisition of orlaco bob will discuss our adjustments in more detail
turning to page five i want to provide some additional detail on the growth markets that we will continue to focus on as well as some specific products that are contributing to our current and future growth opportunities
on page seven the emissions market has become an increasingly complex with an increased industry focus on emissions controls and monitoring
finally on page nine we offer a number of products that improve safety and security on both passenger and commercial vehicle applications
as we've discussed previously our pst segment continues to contribute positive operating profit resulting in the third consecutive quarter of breakeven or better operating performance
as we've discussed we expect revenue growth over the planning horizon to exceed our underlying markets by two to three times this growth will be delivered -- driven by our focus on solutions
we have discussed the benefits of our mirroreye product on fuel efficiency previously with initial trial showing up to two percent fuel savings by replacing the existing mirror on commercial vehicles with our mirroreye system
similarly we are adjusting our gross and operating margin ranges up fifty basis points
moving to slide nineteen in closing i want to reiterate that we are proud of our first quarter
on page three let me briefly cover our first quarter results please note that for comparability to prior quarters and due to the fact that orlaco only contributed for a portion of the first quarter
we will focus on the value-creation process in order to optimize synergies related to the acquisition as outlined on page seventeen we have begun to leverage stoneridge's customer relationships and products
again we spend a lot of time talking about pst over the different calls and it's nice not to have to talk about performance misses and really to be able to talk about the performance
decision is expected by december with final rates effective in january of twenty seventeen we also have pending rate cases in minnesota and in texas
we made significant progress to convert some of our upside capital to base capital with a planned filing to own six hundred megawatts of wind in colorado we anticipate a commission decision later this year
at this point we would anticipate you'd have to go through a competitive rfp to do that
officer in addition we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions this morning we will review our two thousand sixteen first quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments
significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the sec
finally we remain on track to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our twenty sixteen guidance range
finally we recently filed a settlement in our new mexico rate case which was reached between sps the staff and other parties
in position for closing that fifty basis point gap does that require more rate cases does it require you to change the types of
we expect much improved utilization of our fleet going forward which will increase margins for the remainder of the year the majority of the ebitda for this business is expected in the second and third fiscal quarters
a complete summary of the amendment was included in our eight-k filing in early june
essentially we recognize the mark-to-market of the inventory and hedges for that inventory throughout the holding period in ebitda however the inventory is marked to a current value and the hedge is marked at the future value on the curve
actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the risk factors section in our form ten-k
and our infrastructure have positioned us to double the number of rv dealership locations over the next five years
as compared to the cost of building new stores with high land and building cost or the payment of goodwill premiums to acquire new rv dealerships
we plan to offer a full assortment of rv parts and accessories in all gander locations by the end of this year
when we look at the investment which includes the purchase pricing the original ip and the leases associated with them the capital expenditures associated with it and whatever operating losses exist to ramp it up
thank you for your continued interest and support of camping world as we look to double the size of our business over the next five years
but what i can tell you is that as you can see the results for the second quarter in our primary rv units we're positive both overall and on a same-store basis
roger and his team did an excellent job of balancing promotional activities to maintain strong profitability while driving sales growth and dramatically lowering our rv inventory levels
although the investment will be higher than anticipated this year due to our pacing of store openings and rv dealership integrations
at our existing a hundred and forty camping world stores that there's an opportunity for growth over the next two years in that business as well
in the next five years and so when i talk about aggressive we're saying we're going to do everything in the next five years that we did in the first fifteen years
it does sound like a big leap but when you start integrating rv sales and rv service and you start to get some tailwind behind
it's difficult to do that with one brand like camping world but when you show up with five or six brands with a different presentation and a different marketing
our company had a very solid second quarter in our rv business and the industry growth prospects are equally good
this lowered range is not reflective of any significant change in the profitability of our rv business
much like we have over the last fifteen years where we've opened up stores we have noticed that it takes twelve to eighteen months to get to that level where we feel good about the returns
and we were able to rebound very nicely in the following two months that obviously made up for any trend that we were fearful of coming out of april
right so if for some reason one or two of them don't work out we will not let that linger we do not have a pride of authorship we will make a move if we have to to pull that inventory back in and get out of that lease and so
and one of the requirements that amazon has to be preferred not just a reseller is that you have to be able to ship within twenty four hours and we're making the technology and human capital adjustments
sj will review business highlights and provide color on the operating environment silvia will then review the company's key financial results
particularly with cof we are also encouraged
we encourage you to read the partnerships earnings release and documents on file with the sec
these assets have performed extremely well during the year with our overall occupancy rate remaining consistently high at ninety seven percent and the portfolio has continued to grow through contractual lease escalators and modifications
as a result of this venture we do expect acquisition volume to increase materially later in twenty seventeen and beyond
the sequential increase was primarily due to the recurrent transaction one organic drop-down acquisition in december
or fixed through interest rate swaps as of december thirty one in regards to our atm programs we did not have any activity during the fourth quarter
we posted another quarter strong year-over-year growth driven primarily by the multiple acquisitions we completed within the last twelve months and the organic growth from the assets in the portfolio
higher volume activity at the sponsor is expected to drive meaningful growth opportunities for lmrk the acquisition market for our three segments remains very attractive
the common offering in october positioned us well as we entered into two thousand and seventeen but it will take a couple of quarters to fully deploy the capital
first of all we believe the completion of the merger and the integration of the two companies including the rationalization of the two separate networks could potentially take years
so while the potential impact from the overlap of t-mobile and sprint assets in our portfolio could be as high as perhaps a mid-single digits percentage of lmrk's total revenue based on that simplistic analysis
on january twenty five the partnership announced its fourth quarter cash distribution
which is defined as distributable cash flow divided by distributions declared on the weighted average common and subordinated units outstanding during the quarter was oh point eight one times in the fourth quarter
being delayed in closing i think there were some timing issues but also is there some that might not close in that -- maybe our original thoughts of what 'sixteen might be
the reit structure certainly would be a little bit easier for investors from a tax standpoint
as we have discussed with them now that we are a fully operating company now that we have been audited we've moved the number of employees from the original booking center of thirty five employees to roughly thirteen hundred today
we had thought that that day would be two years in the future in fact due to the terrific work done by all the managers here we have accelerated that date of independence from high volatility to today
yes sanjay so first of all on the abs market the market is open and functioning very well since the start of the new year there have been a number of transactions that have
they have a very high likelihood of doubling over the next three years or so and so as we wrap up
and so what we've tried to do is to make the events of july 'sixteen when they occur to simply be the next turning page in regard to this type of analysis which we've been doing for two years now
these data show that our product with aristada safety and tolerability profile does not require a trade-off in terms of antipsychotic efficacy and we believe this will be important to physicians making treatment choices for their patients with schizophrenia
so that broadening of the states needs to occur for us to hit our plans but i would say that no particular state expansion is included in our anticipated guidance for two thousand and nineteen as we said
we see potential for vivitrol to become an increasingly utilized treatment option for patients
including the impact of our recently expanded commercial team important new data from the alpine study and a recent national formulary addition
related to the reimbursement of development expenses for diroximel fumarate as a reminder the pdufa date for diroximel fumarate is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of this year
we look forward to publishing the data from the alpine study and presenting full study results including interesting additional findings on prolactin sexual side effects sedation and other safety and tolerability measures at upcoming scientific meetings
any sort of uptake in aristada on the heels of the alpine study results for this year
starting with our commercial organization we recently expanded our aristada commercial field and hospital organization by approximately sixty sales reps
as you can see on slide seventeen by the end of enlighten-two both groups had experienced clinically meaningful improvements in panss scores with the patients considered to be mildly ill based on these scores
should we expect an acceleration in vivitrol trends like we saw a few years ago sort of kind of following up on the last comment as well
but this is really a new opportunity for us in the va but it is going to take some time because
a spend that's going to be like an aristada like a vivitrol more or less just give us a sense of just
our first quarter results are typically affected by seasonal trends related to inventory fluctuation and commercial insurance plan resets in particular this year we saw a significant impact in aristada inventory during q one i'll
we believe the progress being made in these areas will diversify vivitrol's growth vivitrol operates in a fragmented system where each state is unique in how it activates to address the opioid crisis
to put this into context more than three weeks' worth of total inventory was drawn down from the distribution channel during the quarter
half of those were on boarded and trained in the fourth quarter of twenty eighteen while the other half joined the company during q one we expect to see an impact from these additions starting in the second quarter
on the perspectives we do see generally that there tends to be a seasonal pattern with the second and third quarters being quite strong for vivitrol and those are patterns we expect through the course of the year but we'll continue to update you
and you never would have heard her talk like that even a year or two ago so we -- jim and i always said on these calls which
and this is a market that we really haven't had any -- we've got a few hundred cartons in the va so far for aristada so
like what should we think about in terms of the additional interest enb would have in that project
please turn to slide twelve i also would like to provide an update on our sandpiper project earlier this year we received written orders from the minnesota public utility commission
we've been a little bit concerned about some weakness on that side of things coming into the end of two thousand and fifteen but the strength of
together with the strong supply growth and pipeline takeaway constraints from western canada gives us confidence that we will be able to see high utilization of the partnership's liquids pipeline systems please turn to slide six now
please turn to slide ten the defensiveness and sustainability of our cash flows is further highlighted by the remaining term
moving forward to our natural gas business we expect a decline in overall system volumes through two thousand and sixteen as our system outlook is affected by reduced drilling from producers in and around our assets
we always said line nine and southern access extension would provide us with the strongest netbacks so we've been encouraged by
which allowed us to terminate resellers in the nordics and our uk-based team is continuing to deliver good results
we feel very good with that in the americas and we're also transitioning that model into emea with a heavier focus on new logos
now moving to slide six today a number of major industry participants are deploying significant wireline networks across broad sections of the country
now i will turn the call back to steve thanks drew moving to slide thirteen within a growing economy we experienced the effects of a strong industry environment and capitalized on our significant strengths
going to slide three during this call we will be referring to a slide presentation which can be found on our website's investor center main page relevant slides will be identified by number throughout our presentation
we are unable at this time to provide specific estimates as to the pace and impact of these improvements during fiscal twenty twenty second as many are aware on february twenty five our fifth-largest customer filed a voluntary petition for reorganization
going to slide seven we continued to experience the effects of a strong overall industry environment during the quarter with increases in demand from our top five customers
for a number of reasons we are modifying this approach for fiscal twenty twenty changes to plans or activity levels that occur after the beginning of the calendar year by individual customers
partly offsetting the higher irrigation sales was a four percent decrease in usage per residential customer as cooling and heating degree days were lower in the second quarter this year
based on the midpoint of this guidance we would expect to achieve our eleventh consecutive year of earnings growth
align around what those growth numbers look like but today in the near term those growth numbers are in excess of what's been in our irp and so we will just have to look at it and i would like to be able to give you
a complete replay will be available from the end of the day for a period of twelve months on the company's website
i will close with a look at weather on slide ten we saw cooler than normal conditions during the second quarter but the weather turned hot in july
i would also say that given the fact that we have the aditc extension
and in addition to that what's happening in the region is going to be a consideration also so there's just a lot of variables that i'd like to be able to tell you what it looks like today but we're not in a position to do that that's why we take two years to do this
especially as we continue to grow our usa today network to include more local markets and more new platforms
with q one and some other projects we've been working on to final run that through our numbers and
the judges said it best it would not be an overstatement to say that the pressure for reform from usa today's reporting has significantly reduced the possibility of a public health crisis
our usa today network is an ideal partner to help expand this brand
these non-gaap company-defined measures are being provided because management believes they are useful in analyzing the company's operating performance and cash flow before the impact of various reorganization and other charges
to tribune's closing share price on april twenty two and it provides certain value by eliminating the risks associated with tribune continuing to operate
last summer we launched gravity for mobile already the product is generating seven -- several million dollars of revenue and growing very rapidly
prior to the launch the ratings were approximately forty percent on legacy video players for the same article placement
during this conference call we may refer to adjusted ebitda adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow
sporting events and about thirty of our markets that open up a new revenue stream and we see a much different client that gets engaged in that business as well
we expect a moderate increase in revenues at hamilton beach in two thousand sixteen compared with 'fifteen provided consumer spending is at expected levels
the improvement in net income was primarily the result of centennial incurring a lower operating loss in the twenty sixteen first quarter than it did in the prior year first quarter partially offset by a decline in hamilton beach's results
reserve assets but there's no connection between those two numbers the objective over time is to reduce the assets in a wise way that are
right i understand but as i look for the remaining three quarters is it going to be similar to this or it's really just kind of
and this concludes today's conference and as a reminder a replay for this conference will be available for seven days
we disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements which may not be updated until our next quarterly conference call if at all additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties was set forth in our earnings release and in our ten-q
for the remainder of two thousand sixteen we look forward to continuing to execute on higher production and delivery rates
all three of our business segments have a strong outlook for new business in the second quarter as well as for the second -- or the remainder of the year
about five are expected to be addressable by our product line
okay thank you carmen and thank all of you who have joined us this morning as we report the financial results for the first quarter of twenty sixteen please note that this morning's press release
in relation to the results for the comparable period last year reconciliations of the adjusted financial results to comparable gaap financial measures are included in our earnings release
the group also supported three successful trident ii d five fleet ballistic missile test flights that are powered by our solid rocket motors and two united launch alliance space launches that used our propulsion and structures
in the space systems group we launched and birth the cygnus spacecraft on our oa-six cargo mission to the space station in march just weeks after the previous cygnus completed the oa-four flight that began last december
which we expect to accelerate even more throughout the balance of two thousand and sixteen with that recap we're now ready to open the call
even so two of our three reporting segments generated substantial increases in operating margins in part due to cost synergies achieved
the results of the sporting business are reported as discontinued operations in our gaap results
compared to the first quarter of two thousand and fifteen as mentioned above the decrease in operating income was largely due to lower revenues and unfavorable product mix in the armament systems division as compared to last year's period
as we begin two thousand sixteen our focus is on continued operational excellence and providing great service to our customers who count on us for their important programs
okay and if you don't get it -- i mean is there a point at which in the year where if we don't get one or two bookings then it becomes an issue for the guide like at what point do you start to worry about the range
and manufacturing teams and facilities and so as we go from two or three launches a year to five or six launches a year there's a lot of operating leverage
furthermore a complete disclosure of our gaap financial results will be available in our first quarter form ten-q
for instance in our defense systems group early this year we initiated a three-year research and development program to develop and field advanced
if things proceed as planned the first of an eventual fleet of up to five of these geosynchronous orbit servicing vehicles will commence operations
well in the first quarter the margins in those two segments were up nicely compared to last year and were both a bit ahead of
we have historically done very well with mssp segment of that business as well as the infrastructure and we saw deals in both parts of that business in the quarter
we're outgrowing our sunnyvale office space and are constructing the second building adjacent to our existing building which we expect to occupy in the second half of twenty twenty including spending on this project
as our strong revenue growth illustrates the partial us federal government shutdown as well as concerns raised by brexit and the slowing chinese economy had no noticeable impact on our fourth quarter performance
that included a customer acquiring over twenty high-end fortigate products along with a range of other products and services
the combination of security and sd-wan functionality into a single form factor drove this competitor displacement
secure switches are sold together with fortigates and related services and represented two percent of total fourth quarter billings
but we'll have to wait and see what ferc determines once they get a full commission right now they're down to two commissioners as you know so they don't even have a quorum so whenever that occurs
connecticut in two thousand fifteen and you actually pick those up the following year when you file the returns for those years
focused not only on the electric side of the business where you know there's a lot of investment needed to modernize the grid upgrade the grid to allow for new forms of generation and demand response like we're seeing in the rev proceeding in new york
you're probably aware that in new york is a part of rev the commission is giving utilities and opportunity to earn up to a hundred basis points of incentives
we continue to progress a project we call connect new york this is an underground dc line essentially from utica through the congestion points
you need a good foundation and i think we've done that in twenty sixteen with the rate cases that we completed so we're in good shape there number two
and we're also assuming a federal tax rate of thirty five percent so wherever that may end up
for meeting various targets within the overall rev initiative we made a filing in december
we haven't built a lot into the plan i'll tell you right now we just have fifty megawatts i think jim already mentioned that fifty megawatts in this -- the numbers to date but it's an area where we can do quite a bit more
is -- has like fourteen interconnects into it and we have other storage facilities but we're going to be looking at strategically what do we want to do with this business over the next few months and we'll get back to you on what we intend to do
lower tax rate and you lose the interest deduction and then the capital expenditures fully deducted we'd still be at eight percent to ten percent growth now do we have a backlog yes we probably have i think we saw in the presentation
today's presentations also include references to non-gaap financial measures you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentations for definitional information and reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures
we had some governance improvements we actually added two new independent directors and we were a finalist in the new york stock exchange governance award so all in all our governance has been improved fairly well
and keep in mind also have the ability to build another gigawatt under the safe harbor and three hundred megawatts that we can then repower that again aren't even in our forecast at this point
we believe we're going to get it they want it for the rev process and then the distribution improvement program which is the grid modernization so those are the two that are in the highly likely category
we have our base adjusted net income fifty percent of the growth is coming from secured capex networks investments so these are the ones that have already been approved by regulators
and then lastly and this is an area that we made good progress on in two thousand and sixteen and much work to be done going forward and that's our focus on continuous improvement
but our regulators as well as communities believe it or not who view this as an opportunity for economic development we created over three thousand jobs
that our natural strengths are ready to go if this market does evolve as we hope it does so i guess just to finish on a strong note that beyond twenty twenty there is
we would still have very strong ratings given where we're starting from we think that's one of the things that differentiates us from some of the others in the industry and when you're coming from a twenty four percent or two five percent net debt
looking at our three-year rate cases in both new york and then also in connecticut so we have the assurance of getting three years' worth of rate increases and stability and also our capital spending for that matter in both those jurisdictions
we have the implementation of a safe harbor strategy where we have enough invested that we can secure up to two gigawatts of wind and repowering up to three hundred fifty megawatts and we'll talk about what's actually in our long-term plan when we get to that portion of it
every best practice we can bring into the business from what iberdrola has rolled wide and anything else we can find that's going on in the industry
and would not likely have much of an impact through twenty twenty and there's always other transmission projects that we're looking at but we've not included them in the plan
then the projects that transco has in the ac proceeding would be up next a
technical expertise and a track record of drilling horizontal wells to the new company klr energy was a stack as a special purpose acquisition company
we picked up our first development rig in february and increased that to two rigs by april plus we added a dedicated frac crew that began work in july
the well has only been flowing for about two weeks and it's still in the cleanup process we're excited with the results and believe it demonstrates favorable economics for the second bone spring sand on our acreage
and we expect our exit rate for the year to jump to around ten thousand boes per day
will review recent key items and operational results from the second quarter of 'seventeen i will then provide a more in-depth financial review and we will then take your questions before turning back to alan with some brief closing comments
building companies and maximizing shareholder value klre was looking to invest in a unique opportunity with long-term growth potential and the ability to grow organically and through acquisitions
but offset operators are testing down-spacing with encouraging early results that could add approximately eighty locations
production declined slightly from the first quarter as we only brought one well online in the first half of two thousand seventeen and ended the quarter with eleven ducs as alan mentioned we have a dedicated frac spread
after the quarter and through august nine we have added additional swaps for the remainder of 'seventeen and for the full year of 'eighteen and we will continue to opportunistically add hedges in future
production for these properties is approximately fifteen million cubic feet equivalent per day and will include all developed and undeveloped acreage
work began in september and is expected to continue into twenty nineteen in summary i am confident that continued success on our divestment program enhanced focus on operated developments
the eight transactions that we have closed since june one are strong evidence of our improved ability to execute and our commitment to the strategic objective of high-grading the portfolio
for the remainder of twenty eighteen we expect to participate only in vertical wells
with first production expected early in the second quarter of twenty nineteen also in the arkoma basin we continue to work on deepening our technical understanding of the basin geology and maturing our drilling inventory
this resulted in loe coming in above our guidance range going forward into the fourth quarter we expect lease operating expense
ultimately hedges roll off and we expect the company's cash flows over the next two years to significantly improve as a result
now let me quickly turn to an update on our outlook for twenty eighteen we have revised our fourth quarter guidance for twenty eighteen to incorporate the changes in drilling programs from our partners and other expected performance
production is more than seven million cubic feet equivalent per day and the sales will include developed and undeveloped acreage the first package is expected to contain our developed and undeveloped interests in dewey county oklahoma
advancing these efforts position us to execute and operate a program in late twenty nineteen or early twenty twenty we remain excited about the potential of our large acreage position
as we look to bring more operated capital into our twenty nineteen budget we are working to accelerate additional identified recompletions and infill drilling locations
another area that has seen recent weakness is our elk basin oil western canadian select prices have recently been impacted by the pressure on us heavy sour prices
as a company we believe hedges are an important instrument to decreasing volatility in cash flows but should be entered into ratably over time for a percentage of pdp that you were not timing the market
and we are evaluating the woodford and other formations in this emerging arkoma stack play
not only to an increase in nymex pricing but also the improvement in regional basis differentials during the quarter
but quarterly comparisons have trended positively as the year has progressed choicelease revenue increased by four percent due to fleet growth and higher prices on replacement vehicles
but down sequentially eleven percent to lower -- due to lower activity with several current accounts
finally i want to highlight one item as we look ahead into twenty eighteen in used vehicles there are several components that play into overall results in this area
growing the rental fleet into 'eighteen or would you just hold it at these levels and try and benefit from the utilization and the pricing in the market
supply chain's earnings this quarter were also negatively impacted by higher planned it and sales expense as we had expected coming into the quarter
below the prior forecast of seven thousand vehicles this better positions the used vehicle inventory going into next year as it will allow us to reduce the use of wholesaling and benefit pricing
new trucks at the beginning of next year which will start helping the results in the first half of twenty eighteen longer term when you look at the insurance headwinds that we've been talking about
i'd like to remind you that during this presentation you'll hear some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of nineteen ninety five these statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances
we expect the full year return on capital spread to be negative twenty basis points i'll turn now to page seven and discuss some key trends that we saw in the business segments during the quarter
in used vehicle sales the pricing environment appears to be stabilizing although some risk remains due to the elevated level of class eight inventory in the market and other factors
in supply chain we expect fourth quarter results to be below our prior expectations due to ongoing impact from the two accounts i mentioned earlier although to a lesser extent than we saw in the third quarter
we were able to reduce inventory to just below the midpoint of our target range of six oh oh oh to eight thousand vehicles one quarter earlier than expected
the percentage of used vehicles sold through the retail channel of sixty two percent remained below historical levels as we moved inventory within our target range
okay good and maybe just the last one as you think about what that could mean for twenty eighteen how do you think about additions or what you would do with the rental fleet i know that it's moved around a lot in the past couple of years
for the realization being negative one point and what do you anticipate the difference between volume and revenue to be as you look out over the next couple of quarters
we have available capacity within q two and we could have chosen to produce those orders
some of those products could be four x to five times more expensive than our base baked on coating and it is mostly the middle east areas that can afford that type of a glass window
for the full year we expect constant currency sales for this segment will be relatively flat and that the segment's annual gross profit margin will improve by fifty to one hundred basis points
and we have a very nice technical acumen in that area and that's where some of our growth is coming from as well so those are the three areas that we like we've positioned ourselves as the go-to for those type of applications
next two new frit production lines in al salomi in egypt were brought up to operational levels during the quarter which will increase our capacity to meet increased demand in egypt and turkey
our performance reflects the benefits of our disciplined approach to executing on our priorities and positions us well for the remainder of twenty sixteen and beyond
we expect sales to normalize over the balance of the year though we do not expect the sales -- lower sales achieved in q one will be made up over the course of the year
so to sum up we are off to a very good start for twenty sixteen our global team produced strong results
april twenty one we are in receipt of those letters and are aware of the contemporaneous rumors that are in the marketplace
there are three situations that occurred during the first quarter of last year that were a bit different from this quarter
one what we said is that cicp is one of the highest profile where margin -- inorganic pigments in the pigments space
so that's what we've been doing over the past two years in terms of seeding the future and the customers that we've picked
there's some spare capacity in the pressure pumping market and we're receiving a little bit of incremental pricing discount to accommodate this q four activity
we have been focused on reducing our second lien exposure at suns and cycling out of these investments at attractive prices
which resulted in an irr on our investment of over eleven percent as we look forward we are confident that through our multiple origination engines
this reflects the lower operating performance of these plants consistent with the industry this year versus last year and the fact we discontinued recognizing equity income on the patriot plant at may thirty one upon the close of that sale
rex american resources assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements
we have no interest expense in the current year as a result of paying off the debt of the consolidated plants during fiscal two thousand and fourteen our tax rate for the quarter was lower than normal reflecting several items
can we see the impact of those initiatives is that something that we'll begin to see in q two or is that going to take a little bit longer to play out
does that -- can that break sixty percent by the end of the year or is that going to take a little bit longer to get there
our acquisition strategy has been very disciplined over the past several years with five or six previous deals and we intend to remain very disciplined in the future as we address
in twenty eighteen with the globalization of content and the worldwide recognition of our brand and products we are seeing significant demand for our products around the world
we can develop and begin preselling new products in a matter of hours and can ship from our factories in as little as seventy days
through the launch of our direct distribution model in europe we have unlocked demand and have significantly grown our business across emea we believe further investments this year in key areas such as sales
effectively permits you to be a much long -- bigger brand whether it's eight feet over time or even greater is that how we should think about it as incremental space and just better
and remain excited about the continued growth opportunities in our us business as we have discussed our business is very diverse
so we feel like we're set up extremely well for the rest of 'eighteen and beyond and -- but with that being said we know there's room for growth and to get better and we're investing in people and we're investing in systems
but what we see is that still the aftermarket business on half yearly basis the number i calculated was has seen an eighteen percent growth
so we thought it is better our relationship will continue and it's a very small investment which we are selling to jma so that they become a hundred percent owners
and to identify partners who most closely share our vision for these opportunities given the long ip life
grow the market really from otc into linzess and also how do we continue to raise the bar with regards to the clinical performance of our drug
either the sales or the prescriptions for the two products individually for the fourth quarter
sort of towards the end of last year and that really just supported our plans to move forward in these two indications
so japan historically has been a very strong market as far as gi diseases and i think we're realizing that so i think -- and we're seeing real revenue come back from that market
but what we firmly believe is that in twenty eighteen that we will see a modest price increase in the net basis
part of that's going to be the expansion of the dtc effort this year i think the other piece as i look forward is being able to activate more patients
three approximately fifty percent of current outsourcing contracts coming up for renewal in the next twenty four months are at risk of not being renewed with the incumbent service or technology provider
so our investments are focused primarily in two areas one is digital and the second is all things recurring if you will
okay so this is mike let me just close by saying thank you to all of our thirteen hundred professionals around the world i think it's your ability to help our clients achieve operational excellence and
turning to a few of our notable client wins in the americas a major entertainment company has selected isg for organizational change management in a digitally evolving enterprise
and we have reaffirmed our full year guidance for revenues and adjusted ebitda as always we are focused on creating shareholder value for the long term and are steadfast in our mission to deliver operational excellence to our clients
we remain on track for what we believe will be another record year for isg with that let me turn the call over to david berger who will summarize our financial results
was an encouraging pickup in volume in the fourth quarter reflecting the benefits of connected four growth
it is a good example of how successful local innovations can be picked up and rolled out globally in fact these innovations like cif are now in fifteen markets or more
now looking ahead commodity cost increases will remain relatively low in the first half of two thousand and eighteen but we do expect the level of commodity cost increases to rise again in the second half of this year
we also did five new brand introductions and we did the landmark disposal of our spreads business following the carve-out over the last few years
now all these are clear examples that the new connected four growth organization with the country category business teams
there will be a short-term dilution to our underlying operating margin and eps starting from the point of completion which is expected to be in the middle of the year
the changes we are making will help us adapt to meet the challenges and opportunities of a changing world and we're confident that we will deliver on the targets we have set out in our twenty twenty plan
but i also want to tell you that we don't live by these ninety-day cycles and you really need to get off that
and we also think once more that having sixty percent of our business there and obviously these very strong positions that we are very well placed to capitalize on that
now connected four growth brings on the one hand more resilience to continue to perform competitively despite the challenges and you've seen us do that again once more
led to another year where our share of spend and share of market was comfortably above a hundred this step-up in margin shows that we are reaping the benefits of investments made over the past few years
consumer demand measured in volume grew by less than one percent even allowing for growth in new channels which are not picked up in most of the market data
our acquisitions in personal care contributed increasingly to usg through the year as we started to anniversary them
even allowing for this there was an encouraging pickup in momentum by the fourth quarter we were seeing the fruits of our new connected four growth organization with a much more agile approach to innovation
to put it simply we used to make too many pieces of traditional tv advertising and we used to take them off-air before they reach their full effectiveness
so whilst the quarter three might have been a little softer quarter four is a little better we look at it at a little bit longer time frame than you sometimes do so what we've seen in the last quarter and we don't even have the shares yet because they come in with a
and you know that when you look at the overall period of construction of the ships and how the working capital evolves there are periods where you have cash consumption in working capital so those are the two reasons
with some it enhancements we are able to customize our student orientation and outreach support based on the degree level and prior college experience making it more effective and specific
before i go into the segment details let me quickly review two of the adjusting items for the fourth quarter
this was the highest quarterly result in seven years and was primarily driven by growth within our university operations and lower teach-out obligations
also please note that on april eleven our management team will be hosting an investor day in new york city institutional investors and analysts are encouraged to attend
up until this quarter we had achieved nine consecutive quarters of revenue growth in our domestic drilling operations
for definitions and reconciliations of the measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures
our economic net income growth was also notable reflecting not just fre growth but also strong fund investment performance across our primary strategies
while the vast majority of our growth is organic we do have a strong track record of acquisitions over the last five years we've added to our real estate platform primarily through the acquisition of area property partners
the nature of k-one s also results in the possibility that certain unitholders may have to file state tax returns in multiple states
that rolls off in the third quarter of two thousand and nineteen and so there will be a step function change
the fourth quarter of two thousand seventeen concluded another strong year for ares we generated our highest quarterly levels of management fees
as an example and looking at our fundraising pipeline going into two thousand and eighteen we've launched larger successor funds in our european direct lending strategy and our european real estate private equity strategy
in addition we've developed a significant private fund business where we market our us direct lending products directly to institutional investors a distribution channel that wasn't meaningful to us five years ago if
and while we've been public for less than four years we've witnessed the evolution of this model for public shareholders since the first firms in our industry began going public over ten years ago
including the requirement to send out schedule k-one s we expect that this alone will result in annual savings to our company and make owning our shares a little less burdensome
we have adopted a dividend policy effective march one that we believe achieves the following
is by using eni as a framework for how to think about value there's a lot of variability in what the actual shareholder experience is
i'd re-ask you the question that with volatile tax rates we don't see c-corps going through an exercise of wondering if they should convert back to partnerships and i think that
most of the businesses that are of a certain size and quality today probably launched sometime in the late eighties or early nineties and just
this morning we also announced that we've submitted an election to the irs to be treated as a corporation
but believe that meaningful opportunities still lie ahead of us over the last five years
we have two large successor funds in the market and we have a platform that has considerable opportunity for further scaling
we do believe that some of the existing frameworks and conventions that are being used in both traditional c-corp managers and alternatives are
net of those so i would expect us probably to be showing something around twenty percent going forward with this change we are going to have very transparent current income tax
i think the most noteworthy is being a public partnership and all these k-one s wasn't the most inexpensive exercise in the world
this was of particular importance following the rice acquisition as we have the opportunity to significantly lengthen many wells even though those wells had already been spud by eqt or rice
we believe the most likely paths the state might take are to negotiate a contract with hms as the remaining bidder or to cancel the procurement and initiate a new process
which accounts for the uncertainty of the audit volume and additional capital that will be needed to carry cms receivables for periods considerably longer than currently required
we currently expect first half commercial revenue to be consistent with our full year growth projection in the range of eighteen percent to twenty percent but also anticipate that incremental growth will be heavily concentrated in the second half of this year
though we expect only limited revenue impact in two thousand and sixteen as implementations of new sales will not be completed until the second half of this year
appetite to work more with hms is that coming from an aggregation of accounts to a single vendor is it looking at new areas for cost control or is it really turning over work that
they'll ask us to look at that so it's really -- it's a little bit of a two-way street a lot of our opportunities come from client-driven needs that they're talking to our account management and sales team about all the time
thank you thank you for attending our call today i want to thank our customers our employees and our investors as hms continues to focus on containing healthcare costs in our nation
finally we may refer to certain non-gaap measures during the call and our earnings release and investor presentation
individual provider error rates would have to be more than fifty percent to get above the old two percent limit
we have continued to work with cms in the face of these challenges because we still believe rac auditing is the best way to curb waste and abuse in the medicare program and to preserve the trust funds for future generations
is that due to customers buying multiple services within cob and program integrity or is it due to new relationships or existing relationships starting off with a bigger set of membership
small to medium and potentially large may not be hitrust certified and that is the gold standard for the health insurance industry so that's one of the factors where we see consolidation also potentially
massachusetts and ohio are the only two of our top ten states by revenue scheduled to put their tpl business out to bid this year compared to five of the top ten last year
as i mentioned at the outset three aspects of our quarterly health plan performance give us confidence that we can achieve our full year revenue goal
and new customer sales covering approximately one point six million lives will also impact revenue toward the end of this year
the process can be delayed when data requirements for customers adding new hms products is greater than they initially anticipated
the sequential decline in the first quarter state government revenue was expected until we have a final resolution of the new jersey tpl contract
remember also that pi revenue can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter which can impact either to the upside or downside what we would normally view as a quarterly run rate
from an audit and security perspective on the security of their data i think we've talked about -- i think at any given point we have five to six clients
the states currently scheduled to release tpl contracts this year accounted for less than twelve percent of our prior-year state revenue
projected to run out of money by the year twenty thirty we continue to believe cms should be more aggressively leveraging the capabilities of racs to address systemic errors
we will continue to exclude new jersey from our full-year projection though we now expect the second quarter to include three months of new jersey revenue
we have an internal innovation team which is looking at a variety of new product opportunities one or two of which could be ready to go to market by the end of this year
beyond the end of july until new contracts are set up or should we just still continue to expect the rac revenue to fall off at the end of july
but part of being back to normal is to take the time to introduce our new cfo who
and we believe that the market will continue to be supported in q two so if what i've just said confirms itself then you guys will rightly beat me up at when we have the same call in q two to say that we were conservative on
where it came from if it was i don't know all us or only asia if there was some sort of there that was the first question and the second one
so all of that was contained in the last week and essentially most of it was contained in the first three days of the week
well we have a structure in place that we validated with ofac that they
unless they had the approval from ofac to do so so just getting the shares transferred from that international bank into another account even within that same international bank
and what was in our discussions with ofac and hopefully have convinced you that we have anticipated
fully signed by sunday night fully binding we applied for a sanction a relief for license to operate essentially from ofac on sunday night
if you take a week of our us business it's fifteen million of orders now even if you say that we were stopped for the full week and we lost fifteen million of orders which has not happened we were not stopped for the full week we did not lose fifteen million of orders
impact sulzer's situation does not impact the deal that we have in place and does not impact the license to operate that we have from ofac so we've been cleared
the other question you may have is on  what are we going to do with the five million shares we're not in the business of owning our own shares this is not what we aim to do long-term
we could have offered to buy more shares and the balance that we came to five million shares was what renova was willing to do at this point
we've got some good q one results to discuss with you and we will explain to you the transaction that we went through last week the consequences
and had some active discussions with them in the early part of the week and essentially by wednesday end of business day us time ofac had approved the transaction that allowed us to transfer the shares
i don't anticipate that we'll have to because there is a very -- there's a lot of clarity from ofac that the fifty percent of capital is the rule that they apply
but we have no hurry -- there's no timeline there's no commitment to anybody in terms of doing anything under any type of timeline to ofac or to anybody else
we have these licenses from ofac that we're fully in the clear ofac has been very supportive in terms of getting the news out there they circulated the information directly themselves to some of the banks
and profitability two thousand and fifteen was a year of outstanding execution and of setting the stage for the future with some exciting growth initiatives
we successfully launched a full suite of aero products in our wabash composites business that now creates the broadest oem product offering available
further our wabash composites business contributed nicely as we saw both revenues and margins rise significantly from those in the fourth quarter of two thousand and fourteen that said it's important to make clear that while the
during two thousand and sixteen excessive trailer age remains a challenge for fleets and provides further support to forecast and expectations for strong new trailer demand
the epa and nhtsa are currently evaluating the comments from various stakeholders and we expect to see a final version of the regulation sometime in april or may
at this point we would expect that there will continue to be attempts made to increase twin trailer length to thirty three foot
for dpg we need to accelerate our initiatives to grow aluminum tank market share
pull back on their class eight tractor investments this year but they are not saying that about their trailer needs
of their latest growth initiative with a new line of truck body products as we expand into supplying to medium-duty class five through seven market
and achieved the top line objective we have set for ourselves just two years ago
and is expected to last throughout the remainder of two thousand and sixteen this project creates a logistics challenge that will limit our effective build capacity for the year by upwards of three thousand units
capacity addition to the industry of anywhere between thirty thousand units to as high some estimates claiming fifty thousand i think that the number will be
i commented in my formal comments that there remains more trailers in the system that are exceed fifteen years old
these results clearly validate our long-term strategic plan first established in two thousand seven and demonstrate the progress we continue to make in executing that plan to profitably grow and diversify the business
the dpg group is expecting some softness in certain product segments that i will address shortly and we now expect the first half of the year
of ltl trailers specially designed truck bodies and other product lines that specifically benefit from increasing demand in final mile and home delivery shipping trends
and key indicators within the trucking industry are not as strong as they were in two thousand and fourteen we still see some very positive signals that provide a level of confidence
as a result fewer trailers on the road are less than fifteen years old than there were back in two thousand and seven before the last recession
by december two thousand and seventeen we believe this ruling will ultimately drive demand for new equipment as carriers attempt to comply with these new regulations
and continue the string of strong quarterly results in ctp while new records were established opportunity remains and we strive to break those records
the asp change was attributed to customer and product mix including a smaller percentage
on a non-gaap adjusted basis after adjusting for expenses related to the impairment of intangibles
is clearly going to provide some level of offset to what may be happening in the class eight space
so they're still playing catch-up so they have been placing orders so it's a higher percentage than what we would have expected if we were to go back two three years ago when we would have thought that
while facing demand headwinds in several key markets two thousand and fifteen also saw our retail segment continue their growth of on-site customer support mobile service and tank parts and service
of billed volume on average however some areas of business can report backlogs in excess of ten months with other areas of our business at much lighter backlog levels
for that group to be weaker both top and bottom line than the second half of two thousand and sixteen much like what we saw
our results truly highlight the high level of execution we have demonstrated over the past several years but especially during the last five quarters as well as the progress we've made to grow and diversify the company
and where we're going with the business two or three years ago we certainly weren't generating the kind of performance in the business that would end up generating the kind of cash that we have to work with today
the share buyback program that we did in the first two months of third quarter until we stopped it in connection with the announcement of the abb transaction
on top of this agreement of acquiring the abb business we have also entered into a cooperation agreement with the
after the decline expected in second half 'fifteen and beginning of 'sixteen we have seen improvement the last couple of quarters as a result of good project execution
i hope and believe that this will create a change in the americas but it's too early to say and it's too early to say hurray for the one quarter
where we expect to be back march one with the annual report for fy 'sixteen so thank you all for listening in
in the advisory products we expect these funds to be available early in the second quarter and to be available in the existing map program immediately
and map navigator thereafter when it becomes available
we expected the inclusion of index products in map will further enhance adviser and client satisfaction with the program
if you could box it in of do you still have aum in those channels
with respect to the dol fiduciary rule we have completed the evaluation of our business model and are implementing changes as needed in order to comply with the new regulations
two important program structure changes to map navigator have occurred since our last call
for those that do migrate to the other map programs we would expect that the adoption of map navigator with its expanded choices would be higher than that for map direct
and what percentage of sales maybe in the last two or three years those channels might have represented
the targeted return bond funds the latter of those two which we think sort of has a corner office adviser appeal is still finding its way onto platforms as i think we've talked about in the past
and that really is one of the things that gave rise to as we discussed having third-party support for the creation of our map navigator product and ongoing screening thereafter and i would say those are the
and the attractiveness of map itself we think is enhanced by the addition of the index products and then once it leaves and that percentage which goes to navigator how much migrates to nonproprietary product
actually is when those shares vest throughout two thousand seventeen but again some of those shares were granted at much higher prices so the benefits that went through the income statement
first we are working to create subadvised index funds for inclusion in our map advisory programs
we're also creating a third map program which we'll call map direct
and goes into this amalgam of map and direct and most of it goes into map under that aggressive case and then you say
and again our base case would be thirty and thirty and you can toggle up and down from there
so with clarity looming now on dol regulations and also continued consolidation expected given the scale comments
that you're really looking at your cash generation as opposed to gaap earnings so is it fair to say that your cash generation
which is viewed as a new computing platform and that himax remains a critical partner to the customer in its ar efforts
with little competition in sight we are currently working with over thirty customers of various current and future generation ar devices
looking back over two thousand and sixteen i'm pleased with the significant accomplishments that we achieved through the hard work and dedication of our employees
related to the ongoing client conversion activities and higher operating cost as ifds expands its infrastructure to address increasing regulatory compliance and security needs
for the future of dst and we're confident we have the right strategy in place and the right team executing to deliver on our objectives
still the right trajectory for it to slowly ramp up to about fifty basis points by the fourth quarter or so
our it transformation effort to position the company to take advantage of new and emerging technologies is just getting underway
was sold just a few days after the call but it was included in the ten-q so that did happen in the fourth quarter
an april one implementation and so something that we're watching closely it's not something that i would tell you today i call a trend but
the highly regulated environment in which we and our clients operate drove significant changes to our core it systems
this effort coupled with other regulatory changes have put pressure on ifds which will require continued focus and effort
as we discussed at length last quarter we are operating in a challenging environment and i'm encouraged that dst continues to deliver strong and stable results in the face of these dynamics
during two thousand and sixteen we've focused on the successful implementation of significant new clients and the renewals of other key clients within our financial services segment
which we successfully implemented during two thousand and sixteen we are closely monitoring the regulatory environment as our government transitions to new leadership
and it seems that the investment you're making in price can be promotion shelf pricing more dollars in pc plus
and it seems like that segment of the market has become more challenged through twenty sixteen so how do you balance return on those investments
yes so pc plus continues to be a growing and important part of how we make margin investments to drive targeted sales in the consumer
whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise other than what is required by law certain non-gaap financial measures may be discussed or referred to today
one of the strongest formats in terms of adopting pc plus is actually our superstore format which is
before we begin today's call i want to remind you that the discussion will include forward-looking statements such as the company's beliefs and expectations regarding certain aspects of the financial performance in twenty sixteen and future years
we also continued to return capital to shareholders buying back approximately two million shares in the third quarter
our wholesale partners were thrilled to see that we have recaptured the brand dna that had made us so successful in years past and we were pleased to see that the very emotional connection that our partners had towards the brand has been restored
we eliminated the nearly four-week tiered promotional event that we had last year in our stores and online during q one as these types of promotions train the customer to wait for sales and handcuff our wholesale partners
now turning to a review of our outlook for fiscal year two thousand and sixteen which we introduced in our press release on march seven other than the impact
of our current rights offering on diluted eps there is no change to the guidance we presented
were moved forward into the fourth quarter of fiscal two thousand and fourteen from the first quarter of fiscal two thousand and fifteen the cadence of spring shipments this year
discussions of these non-gaap measures and reconciliations of them to their most comparable gaap measures
as we look at twenty sixteen we expect that the business will remain challenged throughout much of the year we're working through our spring product and looking forward to debuting our fall collection from our new team
had a reverse back to the first quarter of fiscal two thousand and sixteen from the fourth quarter of fiscal two thousand and fifteen in addition the reduction of shipments in the pre-fall line collection is expected to impact our second quarter sales
in addition we have added a new artistic director overseeing all categories along with new leads in both product development and production all three of them previously worked with rea and christopher to build vince
we were also reworking a small selection of stores to ensure that they reflect the go-forward dna of the brand and serve as a road map for all locations
up from about fifty when we acquired it less than two years ago marseille is an excellent example of how our communities of interest develop
germany and the netherlands were solid contributors to big four results this quarter and france delivered solid installations at the end of the quarter
until a couple of quarters ago the bulk of the demand came from the top two providers and we only saw sporadic orders from the other vendors
we're also seeing a spread of deployment across a large number of providers as the tier two players step up their expansion plans into europe
and some are a little further than that where the platforms already there and so we have not committed to as much build-out so as an example frankfurt eleven we did not indicate what level of building
please turn to slide seven we continue to expand to meet the demand that we see
i'd like to start by discussing the group's third quarter results and then provide some more commentary on our two geographic reporting segments i'll follow that with some color on cash flows the balance sheet and as usual finish with a few comments on returns
remember this growth is both revenue and adjusted ebitda and this is all organic
but we are bullish on our ability to sell integrated bundles with directv we are also excited about the business opportunities associated with the potential time warner acquisition
let's revisit the four pillars of our transformation strategy we presented to you in april of twenty sixteen as seen on slide three of the supplemental presentation starting with physical gaming
this attachment rate is nearly double that of the rest of the industry and it also means that we are fifty percent more profitable than the rest of the industry for each switch unit that we sell
while much of the growth comes from new gaming and entertainment ip approximately sixty percent of the revenue annually comes from ip that has been relevant for more than thirty years
what the supply of the switch is going to be and i'd say those two factors kept us with the same guidance
as we discussed in march we had a tax benefit in q one from the planning work we did last year
while our q one results exceeded our plan red dead redemption two moving out of our fiscal year
i also think that e three for those of you that will go to e three you'll see some excitement around some of the games that we have that will help to
this year next year and maybe over the next five years if you can kind of give us a sense for that
now i'll move on to second quarter commentary hardware in q two will be driven by the allocation of and demand for switch
with ip launches occurring on a near-weekly basis we are finding that collectibles provides us a consistent revenue stream and traffic driver
one example of how we are succeeding is that we had ninety three percent growth in our global omnichannel revenues
digital gaming continued to be a solid segment although slower growth in some of our publishers the kongregate segment provided some growth in the quarter and we expect strength in our dlc segment in conjunction with new software launches throughout the year
we received a lot of press coverage in march when we discussed our plans to close two percent to three percent of our store base this year
as of today we do not have complete insight into the total number of units we can expect in q two new software will face a difficult comparison to uncharted doom and overwatch from last may
we have built into our plan an iphone launch that would be comparable to last year's launch of the iphone seven we believe there is upside to the plan if the iphone eight is significantly improved from the existing form factors in the market
we believe that our collaboration partners are well positioned to take advantage of stendra's fifteen-minute of onset
i will now turn the call back to mark to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of two thousand seventeen i also refer you to the financial results and recent business updates
i will now turn the call to seth for closing comments thank you mark for two thousand seventeen we are excited for the opportunity to utilize our strong cash position for the acquisition and development of a new product pipeline
all currently approved products treat the symptoms of pah but do not address the underlying disease
beginning in the first quarter of twenty seventeen due to the change in our revenue recognition methodology for qsymia revenue recognized is based
the courts adopted vivus' proposed constructions for all but one of the disputed claim terms and adopted a compromised construction that was acceptable to vivus for the final claim term
the decrease in twenty seventeen was primarily due to the realignment of our sales force refinement of our marketing and promotional programs and continued cost control initiatives
in terms of total new business volume for two thousand and fifteen we realized strong performance across most of our products and lines of business
turning to our results for fourth quarter and full year two thousand and fifteen we realized strong growth in our outstanding business volume and in our dollars of net effective spread and our credit quality continues at favorable levels
in the absence of those two items net effective spread would have shown sort of that steady eddie performance that you've seen trend over the last three quarters
no more questions i'd like to thank you for listening and participating this morning i look forward to our next call to report our first quarter two thousand and sixteen results in may thank you
i will begin my remarks about the company by stating that twenty fifteen is our third consecutive year of growth in adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow
congratulations to the midla team for the work and partnership with communities state and local governments and the ferc in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome to reconstruct the legacy midla system
along with our ten-k which was filed yesterday with the sec a replay of this call will be archived on our website for a limited time
we are committed to delivering the twenty sixteen forecast that dan reviewed even given the difficult conditions we are facing as an industry
these projects will also provide incremental cash flow for twenty sixteen as we look ahead our diversified portfolio of midstream assets and multiple key resource plays provides a strong footprint to continue delivering long-term growth
uk growth has recovered from the impact of the adverse weather in the first quarter with higher expected growth in the rest of the year
we expect to have around three million customers using this service by the year-end
minute one on day one of the stress you can look out and see how bad it's going to be and because you can look out and see how bad it's going to be
in february we announced an ambitious strategy for the next three years which we have significantly increased the level of investments in the business
as well as the benefit from mbna for the full year i now expect the margin to be in line with h one and over the longer term in line with our previous guidance i continue to expect nim to be resilient through the plan period
and given we've had the paper on the calibration of the pillar two a do you have a sense of where that buffer will go to on the stress
our aav manufacturing leadership position continues to be an important element of our overall corporate strategy for long-term value creation
the meeting will certainly cover cmc it's our intention to cover all aspects of the program and
but also as we have now clearly demonstrated the promise of our platform with the aspiro results we are interested in disease targets that provide the potential for our work to make a broader impact in larger patient populations
and finally we continue to make excellent progress in our manufacturing operations and bla-readiness initiatives
resources that are expected to fund the company into twenty twenty one we are excited about our multiple upcoming milestones and look forward to sharing additional updates with you as our work progresses
for cohort two i mean obviously patients all had to fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study but is there anything you are prepared to tell us at this time in terms of
one of the keys to successfully executing the strategy is having the right leadership team in place in twenty eighteen we added significant talent and expanded the roles of current integer leaders to position us for success
thanks jason before i discuss our outlook i want to reflect for a moment on how our business has evolved over the past four years and more importantly
we have clearly identified portfolio and product line strategies for how we will win in the markets we serve and have developed six operational imperatives that will allow us to achieve excellence in everything we do
as we look at our second quarter results our crude oil sales volumes exceeded the high end of our guidance by almost eleven hundred barrels per day or almost five percent and
it's very similar to the gor in the windsor area if you look at the two charts that we supplied
the highest line pressures you'd probably expect kind of for three q you'd probably be witnessing now so you're fairly comfortable with where you set the guidance for three q is that yes we forecast any curtailments that we might
yes we haven't really said anything yet on the number of locations that we're going to be adding but that's something that we'll definitely be able to give more color on with our q three call
which we provided yesterday evening after the close of trading i'll now turn the call over to mark erickson our CEO to go through some of the highlights for this quarter
we are raising our full year twenty seventeen crude oil production guidance
it's been well delineated by offset well results in addition to our own and we expect this acreage to be in the top twenty percent of our inventory
our initial wells down there and once we see what the gor trends are across our position we'll be able to
thanks rusty let's jump right into the encouraging results we are seeing from our enhanced completions we now have over sixty niobrara wells online stimulated with enhanced completions and we really like what we're seeing thus far
these initial wells should be on production in early twenty eighteen and will demonstrate the productivity of this area as well as help determine the most efficient sizing of our midstream facilities for future full development
and as far as twenty eighteen goes a lot of the drilling we're doing right now and a lot of the wells that we're going to be completing towards the end of this year and the beginning of next year are actually in our southern acreage and they'll be going into the western gas system
and as a result we raised our oil guidance but what we haven't seen is the corresponding increase in gor which is why we did not raise our boe forecasts until we see where that shakes out
then at the end of may we completed enrollment and dosing of the entire sad portion of the study in healthy volunteers
we and many key opinion leaders in hbv see these data as the first proof of concept that an rnai compound can potentially lead to an awakening of the immune system in hbv patients and eventual functional cure
this will help to inform our decision about what dose level or levels to select for the phase ii study and what the dosing interval should be
of circulating s-antigen even so half of these patients experienced a sustained host response where it appears that arc-five twenty triggered something that enabled the body to fight the virus
to presentation of meaningful clinical data in just two years for two different programs we believe this is virtually unheard of and we have several additional candidates to follow
in addition we have started using newer ligands that have distinct advantages and have discovered ways to eliminate the use of pk enhancing structures which makes for a smaller and more structurally simple molecule
yes and some other issues that we had in a couple -- we had a couple of life sciences clients and a couple of energy services clients where we had po issues
from our original number of thirty we also fully expect to diversify our service base there to include information technology outsourcing with our newly hired it subject matter experts
so it's been a busy fifteen months i think it's fair to say in my time here we've been preparing for increased domestic competition
working to help bring tmx much closer to our clients and enable us to build a better understanding of their needs
first as you have seen in the q four 'fifteen results and the press release issued on wednesday we have aligned our operating segments to our strategic pillars this lines up our reporting structure with how we review the business
the decline in market share was not unexpected as we closed tmx select and alpha was relaunched as an unprotected marketplace these changes are made as part of the larger initiative to simplify and improve the trading experience for our clients
our backlog is up significantly from the same time a year ago and our twelve-week order rates are positive in all geographies and segments
our team did a great job leveraging this increased volume and focusing on continuous improvement initiatives to improve operating margin by five percentage points compared to last year's fourth quarter
we are very encouraged by order rates we're seeing in all three segments particularly in the advanced technology segment where demand for our solutions is strong across electronic and medical end markets
restructuring actions are largely behind the company now in terms of the cost are there any additional actions that could be taken in fy 'seventeen and how are you thinking about
some of the benefits may stretch out into the first quarter of 'eighteen and as we build out and then transfer to that facility but i don't see any substantial charges related to
reported operating margin in the quarter improved by five percentage points compared to the prior year through the combination of volume leverage mix and the net effect of continuous improvement initiatives
organic growth for the year was a robust seven percent compared to the prior year this is outstanding growth
the electronics part of ats over the last number of years that we've talked about has been mobile and that continues to be the biggest driver but as we talked about in the last couple of quarters we've
quarter with three of the four chinese mobile guys and what we see from them is more interest in doing more automation more interest in doing more sophisticated
as disclosed in previous ten-qs as well as in our ten-q filed earlier today we have been in discussions with the california attorney general and the consumer financial protection bureau
in two thousand fifteen the usage of cash and operating activities was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable and the decline in deferred revenue and accrued liabilities during the first quarter
the ldg program makes it possible through a combination of employer contributions and scholarships from ashford for students to earn their degree with no student debt
while our current cohort retention rate is within our historical range of sixty percent to sixty six percent we continue to place a strong emphasis on increasing student retention through various initiatives that ashford has taken
we also continue to make progress in our leadership development grant or ldg program
which is more than four times the level for the same period last year and includes contribution to income from each of the three quarters this year
but we do use it internally to measure our core operating results so i've included it in the earnings release with a reconciliation to our gaap numbers
the real story is our results for the nine months which indicates that we have now reached a consistent level of sales and profitability
we continue to have placement for this product line and good sales results in the largest us retail chain as well as in other chains and online retailers and we are pursuing additional chains to our placement to the line
we look forward to sharing more about our exciting work in this area at the medical meetings throughout twenty eighteen and twenty nineteen with that i want to thank you very much for your attention
of course something that has to be a real concern during the manufacturing of course and on the safety of the product but the qc and all the details that we are dealing with
this is where the true advantage of allogeneic car-t cell manufacturing process kicks in
we strongly believe in the superior potential of the car-t programs of our partners
the results we have obtained in all are very convincing to try to expand this in a lot of different type of indications and i think that there is absolutely no restriction behind this
we will of course be extremely open and trying to dialogue with the fda to try to see what is the threshold to go for registration but whenever we have convincing results
our variable annuity business which is included in us retail flows has been under pressure for the past two years as some of our insurance partners exited the business while others made a shift to passive
it occupancy and general and administrative expenses all experienced a seasonal increase as typical of the fourth quarter
while sales have been fairly flat for the past three quarters we've also seen a consistent slowdown of redemptions leading to improved net flows for this fund although hybrid products remain in net outflows overall
expanding our etf platform and new product launches as well as new technology
we did see a modest improvement in international retail flows but that was offset by some institutional redemptions as well as improved us fixed income flows
of more than five percent this exceeded the cost savings projections i provided last quarter
the company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials which are available on our website reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures
how would you characterize them versus your own expectations and you mentioned three things as far as
paint in home depot or specifically ppg brands versus behr
we expect our sales volumes in the automotive oem business to be stronger in the second half of the year based on recently implemented stimulus and easier comparisons to the prior year
the automotive oem business made good progress in implementing selling price increases realizing sequentially higher price in each major region of the world
so david our response is the same one we gave in the fourth quarter that we don't think we need to be talking about tio two this year
and we saw coming into 'nineteen that they had delegated from beijing to the provinces the enforcement of environmental actions and so they were much more focused on employment
the result of spx -- the results of spx flow are reported as discontinued operations this quarter we're also reporting under our new segment structure for the first time
we will also discuss the results of our core businesses separately from the results of the south african projects and with that let's discuss our q three results
this is a very important milestone for the owner eskom our customers and spx as well signifying another step forward in the process
certain costs below segment income need to be normalized to align with the post-spin spx corporate expense includes costs for individuals and other expenditures
we are restating our two thousand and fifteen targets on a core basis we believe this gives the best visibility into the organic changes in our targets
in hvac in addition to our solid performance this quarter we remain on track with our plans for several new product launches and expanding and optimizing our channels to market
which could drive additional value-creation above and beyond the growth we are targeting in our core ebitda model
which i believe results in two even more focused companies that can create greater opportunities for employees and customers as well as drive additional value for shareholders we appreciate your commitment and dedication
recall that these are two mega power projects owned by the state-owned south african utility eskom power projects that have unfortunately seen continual delays through their life cycle
changes in overall business mix in the segment and the impact of the stronger us dollar contributed to margin decline
and that's been a real nice contributor to the business overall where we're seeing the headwinds right now from a margin perspective beyond just the led side is the timing of projects
i encourage you to follow along with the slide presentation during our prepared remarks a replay of the webcast will be available on our website until november thirteen as a reminder portions of our presentation and comments
you can find reconciliations of all pro forma figures to their respective gaap measures in an appendix to today's presentation
bookings for power generation equipment remained at low levels and backlog declined sequentially from q two as power generation markets remain weak we are intensely focused on reducing costs and risk in this business
our ebitda and cash flows are concentrated in q four based on this and with a focus to pay down short-term debt in q four we expect to be back within our target range by the end of the year
as a reminder restructuring charges are below the segment income line and are also an add-back under our bank credit facility calculation of ebitda with respect to revised full year segment targets
and so it's kind of an action that we're doing now that we're moving forward on that we really don't expect to see much in the way of benefit in twenty sixteen it'll be beyond that
batteries are generally sized for two to four hour discharges not usually eight hours and once discharged they typically have to be recharged for an equivalent period of time before they can be used again for a similar level of discharge
regarding the economics of the acquisition thad has already discussed how we redeploy capital from wholesale generation into retail tripling the ebitda on a similar amount of net capital deployed
within the retail space specific to the commercial and industrial segment the combination of noble and champion places calpine among the top three national providers by volume
as you can see from the chart in the upper left during the heat wave all eleven of our peaking units were needed each day that week to serve peak load
the chart on the top right shows our generation volumes for the third quarter as expected volumes in the west continue to track below two thousand fifteen primarily due to the suspended operations of our sutter and south point plants
wrapping up with the east energy markets remained backward-dated in pjm given the expected addition of new generation capacity over the next few years
which is generally consistent with the three-year-out figures we typically present on this call each year
i think they've been looking at a lot of things since they first came out with the california forward capacity market kind of concept eight or nine years ago at what point do you just kind of -- for the merchant plants
at least based on the math we're not actually seeing an impact in our ability to drive the goals that we had for the year so again i don't want to read too much into the market growth over the last two quarters
so again not a major concern it's not far off of our expectations in the -- what we assumed so far in the year and the performance of emea throughout the rest of the year is already contemplated
so while i'm not going to give you the precise phasing q three to q four i would just remind you to look back at revenue seasonality of
and in the second quarter the set business was pressured a little more than the large joints
so my feeling is as we're coming into a year from now those three things will be happening
stay focused on delivering what we're talking about here in the back half of twenty eighteen first and foremost we're going to see how that goes and we will continue to have a bias for investment in areas that deliver a return from a growth profile perspective
as CEO i am energized by their personal commitment as we work together on the path to future success with that i'll turn it over to dan to go through our financial results in more detail
some of that would be in the set businesses obviously so our first area of focus will be to add scale in areas where we already play
i remain confident in the people and the processes we have in place and i can assure you that we will continue to appropriately resource and staff this important work and we'll keep the fda updated on our progress
even if it impacts our ability to get that modest expansion we've been talking about in twenty nineteen for margin
but they're aggressively moving that's forward and having good success so far as indicated by the q two number and we continue to feel confident that we're going to be able to deliver what we expect in the back half
accordingly we are taking what we believe to be a cautious approach to our two thousand and sixteen outlook for shipments in mobile products as we evaluate the further impact of lower energy prices on the demand for capital equipment
and no improvement in power outage severity relative to the very low levels experienced during two thousand and fifteen we expect the seasonality of quarterly results to demonstrate a normal historical pattern assuming no major outage events occur during the year
our overall financial performance for the fourth quarter exceeded our most recent guidance expectations with net sales and margins continuing the strong seasonal performance experienced during the second half of two thousand and fifteen despite the persistent very low power outage environment in the quarter
recall that starting in the second quarter of two thousand and fourteen we experienced a significant increase in demand for mobile equipment used in oil and gas sector
while the power outage environment is obviously beyond our control when market conditions inevitably improve we believe we are well positioned to fully leverage the innovative sales and marketing programs for home standby generators which were largely only implemented within the last three years
this sales guidance is driven by a number of factors including the assumption that power outage severity does not improve during two thousand and sixteen we expect to at least partially offset this impact through our execution on a number of strategic initiatives to increase the awareness and demand
primarily related to our assumption that the telecom capital spending environment remains subdued throughout two thousand and sixteen particularly during the first half of the year
i expect to start to see some of that as we get into twenty seventeen but really accelerating probably realistically towards the back half of 'seventeen and into 'eighteen so i think it's just
the increase is primarily attributed to a notable reduction in product costs given the expected benefit from lower commodities sourcing benefits from a strong us dollar and other cost-reduction efforts
the primary drivers of the increase of the full year impact of the twenty five basis point spread increase with our term loan credit facility
please see our earnings release or our sec filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors
however as the clear market leader we believe we had a notable influence on the end-user demand for these products in two thousand and fifteen as we continued to make investments in our innovative sales and targeted marketing programs to increase the awareness of the category
in summarizing our consolidated sales growth assumptions for two thousand and sixteen we expect total core organic growth on a constant currency basis to be down between five percent to seven percent compared to the prior year with only a minimal negative impact from foreign currency
our assumption that libor rates modestly increased beginning the second half of twenty sixteen and the addition of interest expense from debt assumed with the pramac acquisition
important product level changes on the home standby product that make it easier to install so a lot of the learnings that we took from twenty fifteen are being applied to new product introduction
pretty much all of what we planned is happening at a pace and rate across now all four of the businesses and indeed in our global support functions where
the interim dividend has increased by four percent which delivers the increased minimum commitment that we made in february for dividend growth through the period of the growth acceleration plan
it gives us some -- two advantages really by comparison to most of our peers the first is we don't have anything else in this business other than exhibitions
specialist that we talked about at the investor day these are capabilities that we've added since the first half of last year that i think give us better growth prospect going forward but obviously don't deliver immediately on day one in terms of business
the business intelligence business is improving at a scale and rate and we feel quietly confident that our ambition to deliver a full year of positive growth in 'sixteen we can do
and if so would you like to tell us how much you're running ahead and then secondly was just on the academic business i know that the gap investment was never particularly skewed
all four operating divisions are on track for their growth targets against the gap program so we feel confident not only about the activity but also about the projected return rates
i think the top two businesses which are the main engines of the performance of the group at the moment which were the things we've put under the spotlight externally at last year's investor day
evaluated to be approximately three point three turns per year higher levels of inventory were primarily related to an increase in raw material inventory
and a continued market penetration of our optiload product were more than offset by the decrease
this was a reversal from the negative trends we had seen through the first six months of the year related to the lingering effects of inexpensive chinese imports
we have also introduced a new premium grade product called baryprem which can be used in new applications
this was primarily due to lower utilization levels from the decrease in volume sold to our large us customer
and in the diy space we continue to optimize our product to drive conversion and deliver an exceptional client experience
we will offer more clarity on the potential impact of these changes on our core business when we provide our fiscal 'nineteen outlook in december
what we might expect to see from the industry results at the end of this week when the irs reports it and then i have a follow-up please
programs overall did a nice job of bringing in clients but like i said more skewed towards prior clients than new could you give us a rough idea of the size of the free EZ program last year and this year
and adjustments to other income and expenses as a result of the tropical palms rv lease termination and settlement of the california litigation
high quality h qualified mh assets continue to command best financing terms
the press release and supplemental package provide twenty seventeen full year and first quarter guidance in detail as i discuss guidance keep in mind my remarks are intended to provide our current estimate of future results
page fifteen of our supplemental package shows aggregate revenues generated by our thousand trails properties
bring it online each year well it's really a little bit of both i mean when we look at the demand in the areas where we see that we're going to be able to either fill the site -- some of the sites are rvs so either fill it with the rv or fill it with a manufactured home
and finally our rv revenue grew by nearly six percent we have been focused on converting existing renters to owners and are pleased with the trend we are seeing
the contribution from acquisitions was higher than guidance mainly as a result of the resumption of operations of tropical palms rv resort during the quarter following termination of the ground lease
and enable us to do something very novel within each stage by setting perforations across two different stress profiles
while achieving design proppant concentrations of up to two thousand pounds per foot which would be the highest in the company's history
said -- made an observation he'd been through seven of these cycles and he said in every other cycle the majors and the big -- and the really big independents just bought up all the little guys
the second quarter financials that are part of that s-one will become stale so we'll need to amend our s-one for our third quarter financials which you see before you today
i hope this presentation affirms for you the fact that we stayed incredibly focused on advancing our technical prowess in our well results this year which sets the company up for a very exciting twenty seventeen and beyond
it would be on a projected basis we brought three wells on in the first quarter and two wells on in the second and that probably totals just under four net wells
and what opportunities do we see there to reach the targets of twenty seventeen this was presented in the strategic plan and
and the conditions of these projects are now very different to the ones found five years ago
now talking about ebitda evolution i want to confirm the behavior
ever since twenty ten when we started to see these regulatory and efficiency issues in spain we are the only utility company in europe that has managed to get its results
of twenty twenty now let's turn briefly to our financial results before opening the call up to questions
in order to show that atlas is really allowing us to select the key targets in the setting
atlas' robust biological readout in other words may ensure better use of checkpoint inhibitors as well as enable better vaccines and cell therapies
at sitc we presented new data in a mouse melanoma model providing evidence that these neoantigen-specific inhibitory responses could be tumor-promoting
for those of you who may be new to our story atlas is our proprietary antigen identification platform that we believe enables us to know rather than predict the right neoantigens for each patient
this enables us both to extend our cash runway guidance and to invest diligently both in gen-oh eleven and in prudent gen-oh oh nine clinical trial scale-up
like most bdcs we've operated as a regulated investment company or ric for tax purposes
a replay of today's call will be available beginning an hour after the completion of the call and will remain available until november nine information on how to access the replay was included in yesterday's release
in mid-twenty thirteen we decided to make the supplemental dividend semiannual paid in june and december we have continued this practice through the december twenty eighteen dividend we declared last month
during today's call management will discuss non-gaap financial measures including distributable net investment income please refer to yesterday's press release for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures
during those initial five years main street consistently generated substantial but variable realized gains from exited equity investments
providing us significant comfort regarding our current expectations for origination in two thousand nineteen this expected continued growth in our lower middle market portfolio
please note that information reported on this call speaks only as of today november two twenty eighteen and therefore you are advised that time-sensitive information may no longer be accurate at the time of any replay listening or transcript reading
we also have several equity investments in c corporations which have contributed to our dividend income
we charge two percent and twenty percent for owning main street which is internally managed wouldn't it -- it would be reasonable for us to have to tell our new shareholders
the number of jobs in the state has increased over the last six years and at the same time unemployment has declined to below three percent this has driven steady growth in personal income and retail spending
we've noted strong sales activity at the project over the last few months with twenty one new bound contracts received since march
we also are implementing performance improvement plans that were developed in conjunction with fmi group a leading industry consulting specialist
a i've more to speak about on the coming quarters but at first glance if you look at the reit side of our business as the growth area
going forward we'll continue to advance implementation of our hawaii commercial real estate growth strategy and work through the remaining conversion steps and related events we detailed in our reit conversion announcement presentation including the holding company merger vote
and then from a conversion to reit we expect that we will reflect the financials of the company under a reit structure in the fourth quarter
management will be referring to non-gaap financial measures during our call today
that we expect will enhance communications coordination efficiency and cost effectiveness which in turn will help drive ebitda growth over time
i want to welcome jim to his first quarterly conference call and say that we are already benefiting from his extensive reit experience
as you might imagine i've been drinking from a fire hose over the past three weeks nevertheless i have been able to focus on a few strategically important things that i'd like to give you some thoughts on
and what essentially will happen is the income tax expense will only relate to the trs side of the business
as we said at the time this quality property currently has tenants in ninety four percent of the available space
so to wrap up before i hand it off to jim we've had generally good performance so far in twenty seventeen and i feel very positive about our continued strategic momentum
and finally the reit announcement was more than just a tax strategy i've seen an energetic focus on activities that create value in a way that reit investors will appreciate
the reasons for the variances are included in our earnings release and will be detailed in management's discussion and analysis which is included in the second quarter ten-q that we'll file tomorrow
in addition we were excited to announce just a few weeks ago our reit conversion an important milestone in our company's evolution
in order to grow noi in redevelopment and development for hold
while this particular slide is a bit of a repeat of information we shared on our reit call last month i think the information does bear repeating
thank you jim so turning to slide sixteen all segments contributed to improved financial performance this quarter as compared to last year
we appreciate that some of our assets are more difficult to value than with other reits to help your analysis and to better define our priorities in the initiatives under way we'll be holding an analyst day including a deep dive nav session
sheila this is paul so in terms of the quarter the income tax rate was a little bit higher because some of the reit conversion costs are not deductible
over the next few years so i don't expect to have to put capital into the trs businesses
new projects has not been approved in the last five years we had five years in which each year prices were lower than the prior ones so this is the year where we have changed this trend
i'd like to move to slide three and i'd like to ask patrick moriarty to take us through the financial highlights of the quarter pat maybe you could take us through that
information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our form eight-k dated april seventeen two thousand eighteen which may be accessed from the investors page of the company's website
we look very different today than five years ago for example clinical and technology professionals are the first and third largest job categories across unitedhealth group
in part because consumers they serve visit primary care physicians ten percent more often even as their hospitalizations are reduced
that has been chronically underfunded over thirteen percent over the past nine years so the twenty nineteen rates were needed they were necessary to cover program costs and keep benefits
stretch in that organization's twenty-year history over the course of the last seven years if you think about the things that we
in those more progressive relationships so we've migrated that up to about half as of today and we'll continue to push forward on that and as steve mentioned we've driven some very nice results across all three lines of business we see things like lower in-patients
and we will look different again five years from now as we continue to evolve at an accelerated pace
strong growth together with excellent operating costs and productivity management lifted the first quarter margin by a hundred basis points over last year
it's noticeable relative to the strong trend that you've had over the last three years of market share gains in that segment can you talk maybe about
in the second quarter of this year and then the life sciences market in q four so
in medicaid we continue to expect strong revenue growth in two thousand eighteen and
tax reform impacting that through i guess there's some concern about the blues into next year and on the pbm side with all the deals being announced how your competitors might be responding to that and whether there's any opportunity or risk to pricing heading into next year
a description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the securities and exchange commission including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings this call will also reference non-gaap amounts
and in commercial benefit channels we're seeing both lower use of the er and lower hospital admission rates for patients treated in the er
so history continues to be a guide we expect our lowest effective tax rate in the first half with one q typically somewhat
we expect we'll be in a better position to provide an update on our august call on the capex that we are able to pull forward into 'eighteen as well as the impact
as highlighted on slide three these results were slightly ahead of our expectations for the first quarter and we're pleased to make progress towards the continued execution of our strategic plans
and expect that line to begin service in the fourth quarter of twenty nineteen with throughput volumes ramping up over a couple of quarters
so when you think about people that ought to be able to capitalize on this it's people like ourselves that have built and spent twenty-plus years building a system out there
so we've always had the capability that would be a phase three to be able to loop that line down the road if there were interest in bringing additional barrels to cushing so as we think forward we're always looking at how we can further debottleneck our system
any of the two businesses to bear any extra losses give me another month or two and i will clarify everything for you because
the cost structure everything will remain the same for all the three publications
assumed neutral on essentially a zero change in working capital requirements
where you expect those to go and in particular i understand the content drivers on both but how do you see the competitive environment in each especially in an environment looking at gm's slides where
even if you can't be specific because we don't want to talk about twenty eighteen yet but just in general is there some fall through to make that also lift that bias a bit
so the perception is that wpg will bear the brunt of all of the store closures when the reality is that the impact has been manageable further evidencing the quality and stability of our portfolio
it's important to remember that we own approximately two hundred anchor spaces in our portfolio and that over the last two years we have started or completed redevelopment activity at fifteen former department stores
primarily due to bankruptcy activities that occurred during the second quarter of twenty seventeen the company is now focused on the low end of its original guidance range for comparable noi expecting full year performance to be essentially flat year-over-year
management may also discuss certain non-gaap financial measures reconciliations of each non-gaap financial measure to the comparable gaap measure are included in our press release
in our portfolio we've only five stores which were part of these announcements let me break that down a little bit two of those five were natural lease expirations that we anticipated getting back
do you have statistics on what the restaurants and entertainment as a percentage of your overall gla is today and how it was at the time of the spin and could you share that with us maybe
so admittedly it's not easy to see because of a number of moving parts the fourth quarter as i'll explain to you and randy will explain to you we think was a good one for mb i was quite pleased with it
quite well building a balance sheet with superior profitability and lower risk in twenty sixteen another one of our strategies for building a great company is to diversify our profit and revenue sources
is around ten percent it's also worth noting that even though mortgage net income was much less than in the previous quarter it was not far off from its expected net income run rate
answered at this point but i was just curious if you had any updates on the newer ABL business in toronto
again i think we've done quite well in this area in twenty sixteen we detail our most important fee initiatives for you in our earnings press releases in a table section we label key fee initiatives
second it means that the bankers who came to mb from american chartered were intensely focused on helping their clients get through our september systems conversion and the aftermath
and like i said in my prepared comments i don't think anybody -- well i don't think i'm certain nobody knows for sure how their nim is going to react or their net interest income is going to react to rising rates i think
as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the addition of three hospitals in twenty fifteen hospitals require higher staff levels and higher drugs and supply cost
yes they should continue to go down same thing with our cost per case at the smb line
in the second quarter of twenty fifteen this is a direct result of our ability to drive organic growth within desired specialties and procedure type within our system
this growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of three hospitals acquired in twenty fifteen and includes the allocation of additional marketing expenses
and so we're being somewhat selective but we wouldn't be surprised over the next few months to pick up an asc or a small hospital
we're going to move with lightning speed on this we expect to capture some significant revenue in ebitda in q four from the vascular business
well you also have to look at the etiology of that ar and then layer on top of that the seasonality of our company
which we expect to have completed entering the fourth quarter of two thousand and eighteen this investment and expanding our sales force reflects the opportunity we see in the tardive dyskinesia market
suffice it to say interest in learning about td is strong and we expect this momentum to continue to the american psychiatric association annual meeting next week in new york
we have always considered this a learning launch and have gained quite a bit of insight about the td market during the first year
yes just on the t-force platinum just want to get a sense from you guys is there something that you feel like you're going to learn from a longer
it's -- we understand that these patients on average take their underlying medications fifty percent to sixty percent of the time to begin with
i have a question about some of the data that was presented at aan and
and as i said we've only just begun to scratch the surface but everything and i think that you would agree with us everything that we've seen in the performance of ingrezza to date says
we also continued to generate data to help increase the level of health professional awareness regarding td in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders
i think the re-kinect study is an extremely important study and that is going to just continue to add information over time
and fully appreciate the multitude of negative impacts td can have on the quality of people's lives
we believe this planned sales force expansion can help accelerate td market development and prepare us for the next waves of growth
had a clinical global impression of change and patient global impression of change goal indicating much improved or very much improved at forty eight weeks
what we've uncovered during the first six to nine months of our launch was that our sales team was adding a lot of customers we've actually added thousands of customers to our call universe
do you know what the reasons are for discontinuation the top one or two and are they switching to other therapies
all of these direct educational efforts through our commercial and medical teams and in partnership with outside stakeholder groups are starting to bear fruit as we are seeing increased recognition and diagnosis of td occur in the marketplace
this investment in expansion is a testament to our conviction in the size of the td opportunity our commitment to become the market leader and our belief in the promise that ingrezza can deliver hope to many patients
and the right level of support so that we can help as many patients as possible with ingrezza so i think that that kind of lays out what the plan is going to look like between now and the end of the year
our periodic reports are available from the company or online on the company's website or the sec website
our ability to continue to generate core deposits through our network of only twenty one branches is a key factor in our efficiency ratio
in addition the potentially small compression of loan yields caused by floor rates on a portion of our portfolio is now behind us as we have pierced through the floor on ninety eight percent of the loans with floors
the most significant feature in our deposit mix is that our commercial deposit structure has allowed us to maintain an average of thirty three percent of deposits in noninterest-bearing accounts
the high level of dda deposits has been maintained since the inception of the bank and will continue to mitigate potential increases in the overall cost of funds if rates continue to increase
the portfolio is conservatively managed with a relatively short duration of seventeen months in addition we maintained significant liquidity at the federal reserve
and prior-period ratios are very favorable as compared to industry averages and improved as compared to our npa levels over the last several years
over the past year we continued to slightly increase our level of asset sensitivity as we have now pierced through ninety eight percent of the loans in the portfolio which had force
we were satisfied with our average cost of funds of ninety six basis points for the second quarter
the fha multifamily division has had minimal production during the second quarter but has a solid pipeline of transactions we have been
and current reports on form eight-k identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning
we entered the second half of this year with an active and robust sales pipeline of approximately four hundred prospects
we believe that the more relevant target for us is increasing the patient population that we have access to for testing with t two candida now
european hospitals are very cost conscious and many of them see great potential value in being able to use the t two candida panel to rapidly remove patients from unnecessary and very expensive empiric anti-fungal therapy
customer success stories will likely drive this next wave of growth and the introduction of t two bacteria will be a major driver as well
reorganizing and adding new capabilities so that we can in the future and over that three-year period make sure that we are agile enough
and finally we are confident in delivering on our three key financial priorities
we just have to keep our brands above that slightly and we have to fight with the branded competitors in the same space steve this is mark smucker i would just add one or two things and that is that
in that particular area we took that knowing that our zbb program will be kicking off at the latter part of the first quarter
and just reiterate a couple of our key messages that we have been working extremely hard over the last eighteen months to really make sure that we have the right
also contributing to lower consumer food sales in the quarter were declines across several natural foods brands and a four percent decrease for the jif brand
but i don't know what the e-com for the total category is if it's around five percent but can you just
we are excited for this opportunity to report the financial results for the fourth quarter of twenty seventeen which represents the first full quarter of the combined knight and swift entity
we're not -- we're probably not going to ever forecast right now how many points of or we might get if we got that kind of improvement i think you can look at our
certainly this year because we feel like that there's enough strength and the bid season will carry us through the next four quarters
time of the year for the contracts i mean you're kind of dealing with pricing that had gone into a place six to nine months previously so
we also believe that the eld mandate began to have an impact on capacity late in the quarter which has continued into the first quarter thus far
pass on that thirty percent or so to the driver and can you talk to some of the other cost savings and how they might temper that outlook
at our current rate of waste mining we expect to complete the cut two pushback either in q four this year or q one next year
with respect to the exceptional diamonds when comparing the current quarterly results to q two twenty seventeen we sold a smaller volume at a lower average price
despite the best efforts of both parties to resolve these issues we have agreed that the best course of action is to terminate the existing mining contract as of december thirty one this year
in aggregate the new oil facility -- oil opportunity set we see could add around thirty million barrels
there is naturally competition for such sales but lng sourced from png is well regarded by the market
oil search can offer a value package to buyers that is a differentiator we are offering point to point sales rather than from a portfolio with a wide range of lng spec
i can tell you it's very cold there now yesterday it was minus fifty two but at the end of the day we still have got to be off the ice i think at the end of the third week in april generally
we also see entering into feed on the pikka unit development alaska as being a fundamental for end of the first half this year
something over fifty percent of the total population in the highlands is now under twenty years of age and we now need to turn our minds to how we engage with them
we just think that market is deep enough it's deep enough for a project particularly one that delivers rich lng at a time where
the proposed integrated three-train expansion avoids unnecessary and costly duplication of infrastructure
the completion of the farm-in to the prospective licenses adjacent to elk-antelope and the acquisition of our largest seismic program for ten years in that area has the potential to mature large structures for drilling
i think what worked in terms of programs fifteen years ago no longer works engagement with the youth in these areas remains a critical part of our future long-term success
moving next to the segment results starting with advanced materials on slide six which delivered a great first half of the year
and increasing our share repurchases in the second half of 'sixteen and into 'seventeen as i look beyond 'sixteen we are well positioned for growth as these short-term challenges recede and our strong growth drivers continue
i'll start with our corporate results on slide five overall sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices particularly in chemical intermediates
in particular bulk ethylene prices have been disappointing as we have seen us prices remain significantly discounted versus the rest of the world
we have obviously taking a bit more of a hit in volume than our competitors and we've been clear about that because for ten years we've been a huge beneficiary of having the largest share of imports in china while china was growing
thanks curt i'll transition to our outlook on slide eleven looking at the back half of the year we expect our innovative specialty businesses will continue to grow strongly improving product mix and accelerating our overall earnings growth
you can make a case for consolidation and get it approved when a couple other competitors want to come together in theory any combination of the other three competitors is possible based on our look at it but it would obviously be
our twenty nineteen capital spending will be primarily focused on two areas expanding our logistics capabilities through the growth of our wellsite storage solutions fleet
our effective tax rate was twenty four percent for the quarter and we currently expect our effective rate to continue to be in the low twenty percent range
relative to where your contracted that's slightly below i think if i'm doing my math right can you talk me through the dynamics there is there something specific to four q where your
our focus on cost enables us to expand margins while continuing to fuel growth in that spirit let me take you through two exciting opportunities that will be important drivers going forward
more traditional channels it's not going to be one hundred percent incremental but there's no question that we have the opportunity as we look at the kinds of items we're offering
this progress was partially offset by declines in some large markets such as us biscuits and brazil
are just two examples of investments that are continuing to build and transform our advantage platform
a recently published review of published randomized clinical trials concluded that nutritional vitamin d
we continue to believe that a longer acting factor vii administered either by iv or subcutaneous administration could change the landscape by permitting children and adults to more easily self-administer at home
so we expect our first sales for our animal health division to begin early in twenty seventeen and i can tell you
as steve discussed we expect to launch rayaldee in the coming weeks i'd like to provide our thoughts around expected revenue recognition over the next several quarters related to rayaldee accounting guidelines by the sec
this study will evaluate a single weekly dose of hgh-ctp versus daily injections of currently marketed growth hormones
and the key to this molecule is that it also shows a relatively potent antagonist that feature towards the prostate and so the plan here is to develop a phase ii or to start a phase ii study
we would exhaust those prepaid amounts and the prepaid vat amounts which are treated as corporate tax over the next four to five years
we're continuing to deliver free cash flow and even though q one was expected to be the weakest quarter of the year and will be the weakest quarter of the year
even after the provision we've taken here half of which relates to bulyanhulu we're five to six years away depending on where gold prices go
so -- i mean the q three is always a little bit of a high watermark for our margins
we actually have a mix of on locally hired people from h one but we also have a third category of people from our mexico center
and our proposition perspective overall if you can provide some details there because first nine months it seems to be no different than last year
the final effect has been an expansion of margins of approximately thirty basis points
and addressing the two main factors of growth for the future market that are the management of new-generation content and cloud services these are the drivers that support the business anchors mentioned before
additionally our recently acquired convergent crm system will contribute significantly in this sense although we are still in the discovery phase of this project as for action items we are integrating our
let us now move to slide twelve where we can see a better picture of the described growth acceleration in the group revenues which can be explained through a combination of higher usage and price adjustments
and as we mentioned at the time of the announcement we have already commenced the asset sale process with the majority of the continental us assets now formerly listed for sale with brokers
i have spoken previously about my view that there is a small shop leasing opportunity at ddr and we now have two quarters of improving results to back up these leases
on the spin itself we expect to confidentially file the form ten this quarter and make a public filing some time late in the second quarter as david mentioned we remain on track
we expect rvi transactions to begin closing in the second quarter with larger volumes in the second half of the year
this last quarter alone we sold thirteen assets to twelve different buyers we have a dedicated and focused transaction team and i'm incredibly pleased with their results
we sold quite a few assets at the end of the fourth quarter obviously that noi would be included in the fourth quarter run rate happy to help you there and then the last thing is
we expect this story to recur at new ddr again and again where incremental closures represent net opportunity for stakeholders
well probably the most important and exciting part of that question is that we're actually able to discuss it and i feel great about what's ahead of us in the next twelve months
i think the message has been pretty consistent on this which is that we think the rvi assets are actually a good notch higher in quality than what we've been selling
michael i think -- this is david we thought very carefully about how we structure the fee arrangement between the two companies
by nearly twenty basis points last year we had a flat market in this asset class
you about the amount of donations that have grown quite strongly in q one could you say a few words about your donations
to our results conference at pzu we'd like to thank you for turning up in so -- such strong numbers we'd like to present to you today
to retain a five percent buffer in terms of our equity in terms of our talks or the analysis that we're doing right now if this were to materialize
we should say that the pzu group as you know under its strategy has announced that there are several areas in which we will actively seek transaction
we purchased the bank in june of last year so our twenty percent equity stake
where we have three large entities and having a competitive position coming from our economies of scale this is where we can utilize that another group of topics
we're reacting to the repercussions of the price war as well as the recommendations given by the polish fsa as
what we experienced in our own portfolio in q one we can say there was a lot of volatility what we've observed on the markets is decline on the polish stock exchange
before we let you post your questions let's take a quick look at strategy where we are in terms of its execution if we look at roe
profit level if we look at the overall profitability of the portfolio i will have the same comment this quarter especially the first three months of the year
and eight basis points of average loans for the full year
but on a full year basis increased by eighteen percent as dominic noted we continue to make investments in our product capabilities and client-facing teams
the investments that you made including the hiring in the fourth quarter and we look at the macro backdrop it feels better today than a year ago i'm just wondering in terms of when we look at your ten percent loan growth guidance is it
but with the tax changes and the salt provision do you expect that to decelerate at all next year
at that point because it's too early in the year or should -- is it very realistic that we could actually see loan growth exceeding twenty seventeen levels given where we are in the economy and maybe some tailwinds from the tax reform
to get their capital improvement projects out on the street we've never seen a problem at the local level when they pass a local measure of them getting the money out in the street within the next six to nine months
and they are starting to look at the jobs differently and just as granite started twelve eighteen months ago i see our competitors following with
and at conferences visiting our operations and investors around the country throughout twenty nineteen so please reach out to ron and we will look forward to speaking with you and meeting with you
by completing these strategic acquisitions we expanded our sound platform for growth that drives granite's diverse portfolio as america's infrastructural company twenty eighteen proved to be a year of significant evolution for a company that is nearly a century old
as we saw throughout much of twenty eighteen operational and financial trends held up until wet weather began impacting our business in late november
this work provides critical new balance to our transportation segment portfolio as we work to complete and mitigate the impact of three legacy unconsolidated joint venture projects
and that's our job in the next six months through the end of august our job is to work with congress and the administration
so i do think that the market is changing and the competition would like to get back to the kind of earnings that they were making ten years ago instead of over the last -- they've gotten used to over the last five years
and bottom line performance for twenty nineteen growth opportunities that for years were on the horizon are now at our doorsteps across the end markets and geographies that we serve
as we move into the spring months and into the summer i will say this i think as we end twenty nineteen you're going to see more of the capital improvement projects
is there any way you could give us i guess a little bit of guidance on what's expected from that project in two thousand and nineteen if
half of -- or the second half of twenty eighteen and we anticipate that to really ramp up nicely as we gain traction with granite being able to help
the erratic wet weather for the last six weeks of the year slowed much of our business in the west similar to early twenty seventeen mother nature's influence has carried forward into the first couple of months
discussions and conjecture point to infrastructure as the most logical area of agreement in washington in twenty nineteen we anticipate that a deal will be struck
as we've increased our margin expectation certainly on the work that we've procured over the last twelve months that margin has increased
in the number of agent branches or significant decline i would expect it to sort of trade sideways that number of uk agency branches long term
we generated nearly sixteen million leads to our comparison partners as consumers shopped around for the best deals on everything from the utility bills to their mortgage providers
i joined zpg just over a year ago and some of you might remember how nervous i used to make rachael by counting and sharing the number of days in that i was and i think she is really pleased that i've stopped sharing that with you
would save the average consumer three to four times more than a price cap would so those are the reasons why it's not a great outcome for households if that becomes the policy i don't think it affects
in some sense there's a bit of a step change in some cost categories during half one can you give us more of a sense on how you expect
there was a slight downtick in margin with these products which we expect to see continued down to the sixty percent to sixty five percent margin range
very good one last question for keith you talked about the additional million dollars in savings should i think of that as being pure sort of front end cogs savings or does some of that come out of opex as well
that was in our number and as we were kind of finalizing our results we made a decision to kind of highlight that to investors and split that out into a non-gaap number and that kind of explains a
with the formation of the combined entity between ase group and spil there are a few less common accounting treatments which probably require more in-depth explanation
we have the most scale and we are the most capable in short ase will be part of every solution so
where that is for contribution from ems now and outlook from that if you expect from all the movement in products
we're in the process of ramping up we would like to have the next six months
from your china operations now and memory you had a few years ago with the power ase but just how you see about how aggressive you want to be getting back
please refer to page two of our presentation which contains our safe harbor notice i would like to remind everyone on this call that the presentation that follows may contain forward-looking statements
for example if spil had a piece of fully functional equipment that was fully depreciated zero book value
the decline in operating income is in large part related to extra costs incurred to ramp ems capacity
we believe that the recording of ppa may give a fair assessment for the revaluation of assets post acquisition from a balance sheet perspective
looking at our market opportunity on slide nine we are uniquely positioned to be the consolidator of choice in a fragmented us landscaping industry
can you just explain what went wrong during the first three quarters of the fiscal 'eighteen where organically that business was declining and what changed to lead us to growth and with that growth accelerating going into the next year
however excluding the impact of fx and the morpheus discontinuance underlying net sales were down one percent we will fully anniversary both of these headwinds about halfway through our third fiscal quarter
on the ous side we continue to work with our distributor partners through the impact of last year's currency fluctuation
as joe discussed we expected to begin regaining momentum in our va business during the second quarter and it's going to take longer than we anticipated
this would more than double free cash generation in the prior year or for that matter any of the last three fiscal years demonstrating the potential of the business following our recent period of integration investments
to make this investment in this technology and positions us to bring this product to market six to twelve months sooner than the current schedule
also the addition of our national evlt business manager has shown positive early results
and most recently by a health technology assessment report published by nice
and the approval of an rf device in japan which will provide a very positive boost to the end of the year
the first half we saw a broader challenge in our va business which we now expect will continue into the second half of the year that said our second half guidance continues to represent top and bottom line growth and significant free cash generation
that the additional bandwidth it's going to receive in the second half of this year will pay dividends but it's -- we didn't get to this and our forecast and our belief for this is not a ten percent business but
and the fda notified the company that we had resolved all outstanding warning letters and the letters were officially lifted
a recent positive development was the decision to suspend the medical device tax for two years
we believe this expansion will benefit the entire pv portfolio the team has successfully transitioned our entire fm business to this specialty organization starting in the third quarter and
we expended a significant effort in the first and second quarters which we believe will pay dividends to our focused pv growth products in the second half of the year
the second story for va does provide confidence for the franchise going forward bioflo sales continue to grow across all product offerings and sales of our recently launched products have been positive
to go into more detail on our operational excellence progress over the last two years our manufacturing organization has executed on our plans to be more efficient
improving pricing and to a lesser extent passing through elevated dram costs
we expect our cash conversion cycle to show improvement in q four similar to last year as we further bring down inventory levels following strategic positioning of key commodities in prior quarters
and financial architecture laid out for you at the securities analyst meeting in two thousand and seventeen i'm looking forward to closing out the fiscal year with another strong quarter
we have more than offset recent unit declines and grown operational services orders our most profitable business for three consecutive quarters
to the board for all of their insights during this transformation and most importantly to all of my hpe colleagues for their support and dedication to make all of this happen
so -- and that was pretty consistent with what we did in q two so again i think the best way to think about it
we had one in q one we just talked about one in q three so i would take that into account as you look at a year-over-year view i think rates are higher now than they were before so i would take that into account as well
yes i mean just to give you some financial context around that i mean less than five percent of our total cost of sales envelope
and the other thing to keep in mind is this is not just an hpe thing this is an industry thing so how will the competition in the industry
before handing the call over to antonio let me remind you that this call is being webcast a replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year
from a macro perspective it spending continues to be healthy with robust customer demand the market remains competitive but pricing remains rational and we continue to pass through commodities costs
and then as we think about the server business will revenue growth in the foreseeable future come entirely from mix shift and aup increases or do you have any line of sight into
we'd expect to be at the high negative twenty-day range in q four very similar to last year so those are kind of the dynamics and i wouldn't expect that to really change as we go forward
in addition to strong business performance our efforts with hpe next continue to pay off as we build on the progress we made in the first half of the year
as you think about the relationship between orders and units keep in mind that roughly twenty five percent of total pointnext orders are related to new attach
so i mean the way i would think about it as we discussed before when you look at this business and you go back the last couple of years and 'eighteen is no different
given how well you've done -- repositioning the business mix et cetera gen ten in 'eighteen it would seem that there would even be a little bit more lift behind that so
mix will also play an impact so we're going to continue to mix up and grow the higher margin pieces of the portfolio we've got some nice traction in 'eighteen we'd expect that
after rounds one and two we have been able to make some changes in our supply chain motion and think there is minimal risk from a financial perspective
so as you can see twenty seventeen was an active year of beginning to reposition trimas and investing for our future all while delivering solid results
because we have an established technical center in india within trimas we are exploring adding engineering resources to our aerospace team thereby adopting a similar twenty four-hour engineering model
related to a reduction in the level of past due shipments from earlier in twenty sixteen as we ramped production levels and improved manufacturing efficiencies in the second half
we anticipate capital expenditures to be in the three percent to three and a half percent range as we complete some of the more significant investments from the past years
on a per share basis this represents an increase of four percent over the first quarter of this year
the second quarter we'll get the full benefit of the lion's share of savings out of oib in the third quarter
i'd like to remind everyone again of the impact that the two merger closings in january
credit quality will continue to be a primary focus of our team as we move forward moving on to mortgage and insurance the tables on slide ten provide a five-quarter look at our results for each product offering
we're looking for folks where there is a cultural fit where there is a business model fit where one plus one is going to be more than two and we continue to believe there are opportunities out there for us we just need to make sure we find the right ones
or approximately four percent annualized we are pleased to have this level of growth particularly in light of the competitive pressures and the anticipated runoff we experienced in our acquired loan balances as we worked through the integrations of our two merger partners
we are also optimistic about the opportunity to continue the improvement during the second half of the year as we realize more of the cost savings associated with the two mergers
having gone through two conversions in the first half of twenty eighteen we are particularly pleased with this level of loan growth for the quarter and the ability of our new merger partners had exhibited in holding on to relationships during this transition
they came in on january the fifteenth and so you've got some lagging stuff coming through behind that this quarter we had a full quarter on both of those
as well as the absolute ebitda this is also the first quarter where we have included the bhushan steel financials for the full quarter in our results
so the eu has also -- the european commission has also taken some steps so there is a window in which you can send steel into europe as long as it is
similar to what you were sending earlier and beyond that there is a twenty five percent duty on whatever comes in so there is a protection available in eu and at this point in time because the domestic markets in both india and china have been strong
and in terms of the proposed jv have you already started working on who
so if you see the ebitda has improved as compared to the previous quarter because the steel prices have been quite stable
mostly in the eu that you're trying to divest and there hasn't been any more talk about that since then so what's the status on that
additionally the agreement will provide better certainty in the ngl differentials and when combined with our strong hedge book will give rex more protection and stability of our quarterly cash flows
to continue that drilling program beyond hbp and i think what the team is looking at now is identifying where the best pads are in the field that we can go back to
i know we've talked in the past about westmoreland and clearfield i think based on kind of where we think pricing is going to go and since that's a very pdp heavy asset
and then on average to compare to nymex we would expect that rate to be at the high end or slightly above it correct
turning to operations i'd like to go over the second quarter results and some of the changes we have made to our current two-year plan -- operational plan
even with this slight delay the timing for compression will continue to allow the company to achieve our previously released two thousand eighteen financial and operational plans
under the events and presentations tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-gaap measures
should we incubate some of those products in a new distribution system let them reach a certain size before you put them in the main dsd system because clearly they need to be incubated in a different place in the store especially in the single-serve channels
and fifth it will drive higher cash on cash returns on us capital projects as capital spending for the next five years will be immediately deductible for tax purposes
as we look to 'eighteen do we still expect this trajectory to continue and operating cost savings to cover for that
so i guess the question is how do you -- or how should we think about the roi on all these reinvestments is this just simply -- is this just symptomatic of a higher cost of growth structurally as you work through changes at the retail and consumer level
is sensible and something that we know for sure we can deliver and that's why organic revenue growth at least in line with two thousand and seventeen is a sensible guidance
on q three we may have gotten our balance a little bit off and we're course correcting that balance so
since many of our remarks today will concern our expectations for the future they are subject to numerous risk factors as elaborated upon in our ten-k ten-q and other filings
thanks hal moving to slide six our operations team continues to demonstrate operational excellence as our drilling efficiencies improve our returns on capital deployed
turning to slide ten actuals compared to guidance production was in line with the midpoint of guidance despite proactively shutting in production in appalachia due to low regional natural gas prices
as an organization we're proud of the accomplishments to reduce debt over the past six months however clearly need -- more needs to be accomplished
we want to work with you and we want to be your partner and if you don't we probably don't want work with you and we don't care how much mi
as a result of the amendments these contracts as well as all other current gse risk share transactions are now accounted for as insurance contracts
where do you think you are versus where you set out to be and what are the sort of pluses and minuses over those three years
our press release also includes non-gaap financial measures that may be discussed during today's call
compared to fifty seven basis points for the second quarter and fifty five basis points for the third quarter a year ago
the complete description of these measures and the reconciliation to gaap may be found in an exhibit l in our press releases for both the third and second quarters of two thousand and sixteen as well as on our website
also please note that we will discuss certain non-gaap financial measures in this call reconciliations on a gaap basis for these measures are included in today's press release
as the results of these -- as a result of these steps early this year we are on track to achieve our leverage target of approximately three and a half times at the end of this fiscal year
now if we look at the full year fiscal 'nineteen outlook and you can turn to slide eight for that
to be very blunt the only thing we saw in the quarter was a little bit of weakness in hhi so we expect a little bit more sales there
we still expect a strong performance from hhi this year driven by strong innovation such as the recent unveiling of a new line of wi-fi-enabled halo smart locks at the consumer electronics show just this past january
but if i get a new win today a new listing today i don't ship it for six months in that business so that's really where we see kind of the june and september quarter being much stronger in that particular unit
if i could have everyone turn to slide seven now turning specifically to the quarter q one is traditionally the smallest quarter of our year and we delivered results that were generally in line with our expectations
hurricane recovery revenue in retail it was also driven by two significant nonrepeating promotional loadings last year
and we still think we have a pretty solid year in hhi obviously it's going to take us a couple of quarters to get appliances stood back up and reinvest
we also successfully completed the divestiture and deconversion of the previously disclosed five branch locations in columbus indiana and greensburg indiana
forecasting there in the third quarter compared to the second quarter so two of the big things one is we're forecasting lower
we made substantial progress on our cost-saving activities during the quarter as we completed the consolidation of forty one banking centers
further cost saves will continue to phase in over the coming quarters and are expected to be fully realized by the end of two thousand and eighteen these milestones were important steps that enable us to successfully execute our strategy
as shown on slide seven loan and deposit mix were relatively unchanged post merger
we are committed to maximizing synergies between the two legacy companies and will continue to identify opportunities for future efficiency
on february seven we shared that new vision with our global employee community at an event broadcast from alice tully hall in new york city
all grew double digits in q four in both online and meetings with particular outperformance from online
on a global basis member average length of stay continues to be more than nine months for members in both meetings and online plans and this reflects improvements in the member experience
not another company our competition is the ninety percent-plus of people believing they can become healthy or lose weight on their own
building on this very encouraging start to two thousand eighteen and to create the kind of future impact we want weight watchers to have
today healthy is the new skinny increasingly people who join weight watchers are interested in something more than getting into a size eight jean they want to feel healthy and happy at every size
for fifty five years weight watchers has inspired people to come together and begin a journey of positive lasting change
but if we're truly to become a health and wellness brand we have to inspire people to be healthier all year long so in two thousand eighteen we're introducing a new campaign globally summer of impact
and we'll create new ways for those who haven't tried weight watchers to experience our community ww cruise is a great example
guiding to three hundred basis points improvement in 'eighteen it just shows how well this business model responds
the remainder of my comments i'm going to speak to the midpoint of our full year eps range and on a constant currency basis
the key components of the impairments and unusual items are outlined on slide seven of our investor presentation and i'll talk briefly to the key -- to each of the five categories in the table
that process and the consequential accounting adjustments are very deliberate and focused on simplifying ahg's operations so that we are ready and able to capitalize on opportunities
in addition to this we've done a broader review of all of our recent it investments to ensure that any residual exposures are now addressed we consider this review as complete and now final
however rl has not met our budget expectations for the reporting period and this triggered a review of the carrying value of the intangible balances
that is evident in the waterfall chart on slide eight which takes you through the key movements from the prior half year
and the momentum coming out of the first half will continue into h two now is the right time to review the options to take this business forward
we had circa -- i think it was five hundred cars that were fully written off so our deliveries in the first half were negatively impacted by our inability to deliver not only new car stock that was sitting
with more than three hundred patients enrolled we believe that the advocate trial is the largest randomized controlled clinical trial of a novel drug candidate
the advocate trial will assess the durability of avacopan's impact on safety and efficacy over a sustained one year of treatment
half of the c three g patients will be on the empirically derived standard of care
these two trials are now proceeding in parallel and actively enrolling patients
we are now focused on completing the trial with high-quality data sets and in preparing for our submission to the fda so that we can file as rapidly as possible
the trial is not only blinded but quite large relative to the c three g orphan patient population
as you can see again on our last slide slide ten our relentless pursuit of advancing clinical development has led us to the threshold of an exciting future
the possibility that we might actually convert also to having superiority at week fifty two but i will stress in terms of regulatory precedents
to be able to start entertaining the discussion with agents -- agencies or at least knowing what we need to do in the next step to bring home a definitive answer in the nephrotic fsgs so
these risks are described in the company's filings made with the securities and exchange commission including the company's annual report on form ten-k
i will outline for you how this is lining up for a beautiful choreography of releasing three key sets of top line data in quick succession starting in the coming year
the advocate trial itself is big news for our company and more importantly for the patients
based on emerging science and on expert investigator feedback and with the aim of having the most comprehensive and controlled trial ever attempted in c three g we
we are completing the advocate trial and preparing to share top line data in the fourth quarter of this coming year
i would say that overall the patient populations in the advocate trial
and then the only other question i have was just with the -- are you going to release the interim data from the hs study
also a very good question the short answer is no and the reason is the way we've set up the trial is that we will collect all of the data on fifty two weeks
and if it scales the way it did in phase ii with avacopan that will be a very powerful discussion with those agencies
the remainder of this first quarter shortfall was execution related and while these revenues should shift forward in two thousand and sixteen we expected to capture them in the first quarter
resulting in the associated move from our oe customers to seize that opportunity for efficiency including inventory rationalization
we're closely working with our customers to bid new programs with rolls-royce safran ge and utc that will generate aftermarket revenues going forward
however for us a potential offset to that could be additional demand for c-one thirty s in addition to these military
while seeing a continuation of our transitional status into two thousand sixteen is disappointing we are working as best as we can to get this work done and in the meantime to better anticipate and respond to the challenges we see externally
which are more apparent today than they were last fall when we first presented guidance for fiscal twenty sixteen as curtis has already mentioned
so that is real and tangible the fact that i can go put my finger on our four problem sites that are not really hitting on all cylinders is encouraging to me
within that if you parse it out where you're maybe seeing a little surprise to the upside or you're seeing anything that's giving you a little more confidence here heading into the next three quarters
i know you said you're not looking at selling the entire enterprise but why not take a look at selling these four plants or other specific businesses that have been chronically problematic yes
while we knew these factors were a risk for the year the headwinds firmed up earlier than anticipated and begin impacting us within the last ninety days
i'll call out a couple of factors affecting the comparison incremental revenue from the dat acquisition was partially offset by a negative impact from foreign currency
we continue to evaluate our assumptions on commercial oe in general
specific to the e three program we now have lean transformation activities either planned or being implemented in nearly three million square feet of space throughout our global operations
again i'm very encouraged by the initial leading indicators that i'm seeing as we deploy the e three lean transformation across the business
we launched wave three of the initiative in january identifying several more product areas to focus on and business functional spending targets that can be improved upon
the income tax rate in the quarter was a net benefit of oh point three percent this benefit was the result of the lower net income and discrete benefits
turning to our revised guidance for the year as i have described the slow start to two thousand and sixteen was the result of a combination of factors in three platforms which led directly
we needed to do that to open up a bunch of footprint because we're integrating dat and another business that wasn't even one of our big six integration projects into that same footprint which is going to work really well it fits the model perfectly
the primary adjustment is to add the month of october twenty fourteen into the first quarter and shift the other months appropriately
there was kind of no heads up of that when you reported november nineteen so
in new york on june seven and we'll be sending out the invitation for that soon so if you would like to make sure you're on that invitation list please e-mail
of course you could find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-gaap financial measures referred to in our remarks also on our website
in fact a number of our luxury and upper-upscale pipeline rooms exceed that of our next three largest global competitors combined
absolutely entirely -- essentially entirely from rate which does help us to the extent of trying to hold on to as much margin as we can however we have typically thought about needing about three percent revpar growth to hold on to margin
the commission reduction is not likely to have much of an impact in twenty eighteen that will build over the years ahead as more new bookings get made
it is what has driven us to not just acquire starwood but to try and compete with thirty different brands and have the kind of
marriott is a company with a more than ninety-year history of creating value for its shareholders and we are committed to continuing to do so
these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our sec filings
in places such as oklahoma north dakota and louisiana to name a few excluding houston we note that revpar for our hotels in these us markets
luxury hotels in miami benefited from florida and caribbean hotels still out of service from the twenty seventeen hurricanes
i've looked through every individual hotel that left the system in the first quarter of twenty eighteen it's never a surprise to see that many of those hotels
we look forward to rolling our hotels onto a single reservation system in stages with the first group of hotels converting in the fall of twenty eighteen and finally we expect owners will continue to see significant cost savings
the change in commission rates triggered a considerable number of new group bookings in the first quarter largely for meetings taking place in twenty twenty and beyond
we believe incentive fees will increase at a roughly ten percent rate which is faster than we previously modeled largely due to the stronger revpar and margin growth in the asia pacific region
pulling two big companies like this together and two sales forces and the uncertainty that comes from that
something like forty hotels open shanghai is the most international city in china our hotels are skewed dramatically towards the high-end
because when we add up the credit card the fx the revpar and the units it almost seems to point to something in the teens
we caution you that the actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the sec
this year's budget is expected to be roughly fifty-fifty as we look toward next year and assuming commodity prices stay similar
and so that capital is available to redirect into drilling so i feel good about this year i feel good about where we're going in twenty twenty and we'll stay that program
so the way i look at this year next year is we're going to basically use up about forty ducs in our inventory
we would expect this allocation to continue to weight heavier to the scoop over time
as we heighten our focus on returns in two thousand and nineteen we look to allocate capital to the highest return prospects within the portfolio
a bulk of our capital in the first half because we have this duc inventory i really want to get on production
furthermore as the company's asset base continues to develop we forecast that our base level corporate decline shallows and assuming a maintenance capital scenario in two thousand and twenty similar to this year
should commodity prices improve late this year or in twenty twenty we foresee this as temporary and would remain disciplined to our program
probably past the midpoint of the year to get a sense of what it looks like but the plan in two thousand and twenty is to do the same thing to be fully hedged and to protect that program given the volatility in the markets
and so i see us being fully hedged in twenty twenty the real question is at what point we do that i have a little bit of a more optimistic view but
in our prepared remarks we may use some non-gaap financial measures reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure are available in the supplemental section of our press release
the majority of the three point nine point increase in the underlying property loss ratio was related to these storms and this adverse weather contributed to an increase in underlying auto comprehensive frequency in the quarter
and seventy years of history and understanding this segment so getting our hands around that
investment results were strong across all three operating segments and life and mortality was modestly favorable to actuarial models
the underlying auto combined ratio for the quarter included about one point of current accident year reserve strengthening related to the elevated loss trends we've been discussing
which remains strong at eighty four percent in addition to overall rate we are enhancing claim practices with an eye towards improving efficiencies and our customers' experience
adverse weather has weighed on auto results for most of twenty sixteen and we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter historically our underlying auto loss ratio was elevated by five to six points in the fourth quarter
several factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are described in detail in the risk factors section of the clean energy's form ten-q filed may five two thousand and sixteen these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release
these carriers are responsible for the majority of all usps transportation missions as part of their contract renewals the postal service is starting to require its outside carriers to use natural gas where it is cost-effective
our twelve percent increase in revenue in the first quarter was driven by a better effective price per gallon on higher volume
the company's non-gaap eps and adjusted ebitda will be reviewed on this call and excludes certain expenses that the company's management does not believe are indicative of the company's core operating business results
non-gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to gaap results
in addition comments may also include non-gaap financial measures those measures are reconciled to the comparable gaap measures and are included in the press release and the earnings slide materials
and it was the indirect impact that really we think is one of the drivers of the red material cost inflation that you see on page fourteen and that
it had actually increased pretty significantly in q one as a result of borrowing to fund the aclara acquisition in february so a lot of hard work from the team went into reducing that balance from the q one level
i think on the d side it's much more -- there has been some construction supported by
let me first discuss our progress toward reestablishing high quality uninterrupted manufacturing supply the most critical corporate objective for sientra for the past eighteen months
to scale manufacturing of our highest demand skus ahead of fda approval so that we can continue offer this broad portfolio
specifically we are removing noncash items for this non-gaap measure we believe this metric is a better proxy for measuring the success of a high growth organization
as a reminder i would like to reiterate that we expect our breast product sales to remain steady in similar to twenty sixteen levels
as we disclosed on our last call we submitted our pma supplement
since we acquired the products in the fourth quarter of two thousand sixteen and we are encouraged by our physician customer reaction and the base we have for expansion into the reconstruction market
through our precision controlled launch leading up to resupply as we have previously stated we remain on track to have full scale inventory levels in the second half of twenty eighteen following pma approval of the vesta facility
our plan to achieve comprehensive full-scale manufacturing is on track and we are diligently preparing for the pending fda inspection of our facility ahead of anticipated approval by the end of this year
with continued confidence for approval as we've said before by year end two oh one seven second we continued the execution of precision controlled launch strategy
to the fda on march thirteen slightly ahead of plan putting us one step closer to final approval of new commercial production and resupply we're continuing to work with our team and very experienced consultants
in the second half of two thousand seventeen we remain on track to meet our supply objectives for the back half of this year and beyond and look forward to leveraging this unique technology
we also outlined our planned priorities for two thousand seventeen and our longer term goal of becoming a leading diversified global aesthetics company
we have also just completed a rebranding effort for biocorneum to elevate the premium messaging and look at the product to more closely align with the sientra premium image
that steady -- there could be a little dip going into q two because you always wonder about what the orders look like as you go into q two especially if you got some orders towards the end of the quarter in q one but there was a lot of focus on our sales force
and finally regulatory capital ratios all exceed the levels required to be considered well capitalized and the tangible common equity ratio increased from seventhirty nine percent and at the end of the first quarter to sevenseventy six percent as of the end of the second quarter
these statements are not a guarantee of future performance and results may differ materially from those projected i ask you to refer to our sec filings for a full discussion of the company's risk factors
additional information on our hedge positions can be found in our investor presentation and in our information on file with the sec
and finally we will use non-gaap financial measures in this morning's discussion to help our unitholders and the investment community better understand our operating performance
the investor presentation available on our website includes an appendix that reconciles these non-gaap financial measures to gaap measures
but i think what gives it us is that there's opportunities that we see in there where through the -- perhaps the rofo that we had as part of the midstream transaction and some other activities that other parts of the organization are undertaking
turning to slide seven luminant once again delivered strong commercial performance during the quarter
of the overall power pricing environment in ercot is that low power prices are being driven by lower heat rates
nevertheless the electricity market structure in ercot is in our view the most constructive for retail competition particularly those with a strong set of capabilities
that resulted from the mild weather in the quarter but the impact of the lower volumes was partially offset by txu energy's strong margin management and the customer account performance
for example in ercot the retail electric provider has full ownership of the customer relationship including performing the billing function and customer service with the exception of outages which is handled by the wires company
the integrated nature of our business provides the platform to achieve what we believe will be attractive economic and ebitda contributions once the project is commercially operational which we expect to be in line in the summer couple of other points on this
there's less pressure and probably the time to implement anything out of epa has moved out in time
not a lot of investments being announced and we wouldn't expect any in the future frankly zero on the combined cycle plant side of things that you see that the market has finally reached
as you know there are a number of opportunities that may be out there given the low pricing in ercot we see them to be plentiful with potential for strong economics
on the leading edge of changing customer needs and through our research we expect our new product combining two of the elements
i don't know if churn will ever go to zero i can tell you our goal as a company is to be as flat as we can and also grow
on the funding side our total average deposit rate at the end of this quarter was seventy three basis points including the impact of non-interest-bearing
less than five percent of our multifamily book is in texas with most of these properties located in dallas or austin
but i think that it's probably just best to stick with that guidance in the threeeighty percent to four percent range for that
we've seen the first signs in 'sixteen of positive net new money coming from the new joiners but i think it should come through
so if the markets are more or less where they are the FX do not go crazy then you can calculate that in one two years we will be again well capitalized from our own capital generation
globally that will take us to twenty twenty there are a series of other important project and initiative that we need to carry through to continue developing the firm and continuing growing the firm successfully
but obviously with the prospect of net new money and then obviously contribution to the bottom line in the next twenty four months the vast majority of these bankers joined us in switzerland on the swiss platform in asia and in monaco
plus in view of the introduction of the automatic information exchanges of one st of january two thousand and eighteen i think that beyond that point we should see outflows due to regularization tailing off across the sector so
clients that are direct clients of the firm will be on this platform and then the three basis points should come through on the entirety of the asset base in scope
in line with that i think you've seen over the last two years we've started
to take a decision on what is the best for us as a firm and obviously for the shareholders we'll balance that between the two next question on the phone
and with the agenda that is currently being pursued we understand that it's more of a refocus on us interest that will leave a big space out there that will have to be filled by someone
we're in 'seventeen focusing on the european booked clients and then we will take care of the asian clients on the discretionary side you've seen we've
the third pillar of our strategy is continued large investment in infrastructure and technology i mean in two thousand and sixteen we've invested the most
it's not that we're not investing on the swiss platform but we started with the front application you may have seen in 'sixteen we rolled out
a mix of gdp growth and ultimately a mix of interest rates going up where people will not want to sit on the sideline and give up opportunities to generate revenues
we will continue to make major investments into three areas which we believe underpins the business model of julius baer first
and then we'll see whether the gdp trend the first few decimals that we've seen moving in the right direction be it in europe or in other parts of the world
moving forward there are two ways how we're going to be engaging with the client either on an advisory basis
created in 'sixteen a new division that focuses solely on managing money for clients and here again we deployed our services in different levels
okay you could argue that before the two thousand and eight crisis it was an environment where clients believed in a bright future and therefore were holding less cash to create returns in the market
been with the group for thirty four years will go into retirement at the end of this year on grounds of age so that's also an opportunity for us to refresh the leadership team and i need to lead
we'll go back to the phone we have the next three questions from the phone
below one million that is not directly connected to a bigger relationship and
these include adding clinical sites and increasing enrollment in the ongoing phase ii clinical trial
as we have said consistently our goal is to initiate a first pivotal registration study for tipifarnib in twenty eighteen and i'm very pleased with the team's progress toward achieving this important objective
we are encouraged by our results that demonstrate the ko-five three nine has the potential to be active in subtypes representing approximately half of patients with aml and drive robust and persisting responses in preclinical models
we are very excited by our data in hras mutant head and neck cancer and the promise it offers to patients we are squarely focused on delivering on our goals and look forward to sharing our continued progress with you
in new york on november sixteen more details to follow if you have any additional questions in the meantime
that covers the update on our product candidate development programs i'll now turn the call over to heidi for discussion of the financial results for the third quarter of twenty seventeen heidi
needed to move this program from where it is today as a positive phase ii into pivotal development and i alluded to some of that in the prepared remarks relating to
this very impressive phase ii data set that not only we're talking about but we find the investigators are talking about amongst themselves
response rates for the three agents approved in the second line are in the range of thirteen percent to sixteen percent and median overall survival is six to eight months
we believe that our current cash cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund current operations into two thousand nineteen with that i will now turn the call back over to troy
the very high level of clinical activity both in terms of the response rate four out of the first six patients responding as well as the durability so what that means in terms of thinking about a pivotal trial is
understanding it hasn't closed yet but when we're looking out to fiscal 'seventeen and beyond can you just give us a sense for what the sort of margin profile looks like whether
others will realize that they did need it and there'll be another kind of surge in sales i think in 'sixteen so
through 'sixteen kind of calendar year because i think some things will fall out -- i think some clients will fall out and realize they should have had the product
that refer to future events and thus involve risk refer to the usual disclosures as marty indicated second quarter financial results for fiscal two thousand and sixteen represented a continuation of the solid start we had to the year
while both are doing fine they just simply don't -- are not as strong as they were in the prior year for the fourth quarter we expect hrs revenue growth will be within the full year range in addition
should we think of the aca compliance offering as having been a significant part of bookings and something that
and it's really nothing more than the fact that under fifty we're -- we were
we think that'll really start to come down towards end of the year as the economy picks up and in twenty nineteen you should start to see a convergence back
the probable extension of the opec agreement until twenty nineteen and a possible iranian supply shock counteract those forces
this is the lowest reading of inflation since the end of twenty fourteen and well within the central bank's target range of two percent to four percent the significant decrease in inflation has been driven by lower variations in food and tradable prices
but our goal is to continue to drive growth in the business at that four percent to five percent range over the
that continues to be a part of the productivity story in psm when we can add a new asset and close a facility get rid of overhead
we continued to win in the higher value segments of the business performance athletic is a good example where growth has been consistently strong better than fifteen percent annually over the past couple of years
reflecting the timing of various rollouts where we continue to expect sales to be up about fifteen percent for the full year
and we'll leverage our leadership position in rfid to build partnerships and grow share within the core business
on the actions you're taking now in terms of benefit for 'seventeen and later
we've been at or above the high end of our long-term target range for organic sales growth for the past two quarters
and while we had been improving the operating margin each year in the business we fell behind in the trajectory needed to achieve our two thousand eighteen targets
this product continues to be very well received by users daily active user is approaching ten million
such as xingyun and super vip service
our earnings release was distributed yesterday and it is now available on our IR website as well as newswire service
our mobility effort is anchored around two broad fronts
the bigger revenues from the master service agreement with tim related to the sites
moving to slide eleven let me show you our historical economic performance from the first q pro forma to present day
as a result of the higher policy obligations we now estimate that the underwriting margin percentage for our direct response operations will be in the range of seventeen percent to nineteen percent for the year
and will transition all administration to silverscript early in two thousand and seventeen the net proceeds from the sale are expected to be offset
our strong results in twenty fifteen reflect our continued progress with the year playing out essentially as we planned
we continue to drive down overhead cost as a percentage of revenue leveraging zbb to identify areas of opportunity and capture the savings
creates an approximately fifty basis point headwind so we're now likely to be at the lower end of that range
we'll talk more about our strong cash flow generation at the upcoming cagny conference
and i think the things that we're executing today have resulted in the progress we've made thus far and they're the same things that are going to drive us through 'eighteen it's as i said earlier it's not really a new
between our competitive position and our customer response making sure that it's a net positive impact so in the near term particularly in twenty sixteen the bulk of the -- of our strategic actions are -- will continue to be focused
as you can see on slide eight our organic growth accelerated sequentially as the year progressed while our share performance was strongest in the fourth quarter
we also expect to continue to reduce overheads as we execute our zbb program as we adjust our organization model and we realize the first savings from migrating back-office processes to global shared services
we expect to deliver this margin target by continuing to focus on three things first productivity gains from our supply chain these are funded and in our plan and we're now expanding and replicating a model that's working
as you know jde is a private company so we won't share significant detail on their results or projections jde management expects performance to be pressured this year
i think the bigger picture point on skus sku reduction is really about allowing us to focus on the power brands
our advantaged platform provides us with the potential to be among the fastest-growing consumer companies with substantial margin upside and strong eps growth
as expected higher prices were the key driver contributing about seven percentage points of growth
that was largely related to the ninety basis point impact of our strategic actions to improve revenue mix as well as the price elasticity we experienced earlier in the year
we would have expected to be at the high end of the committed range of fifteen percent to sixteen percent had we not deconsolidated venezuela
in two thousand fifteen as we began to transition key processes in many cases we maintained duplicate resourcing until we were confident that the migration was successful
over the five-year period all of that while still generating double-digit eps growth and strong cash flow so we think our underlying business fundamentals are quite solid there's obviously a lot of moving pieces in this challenging environment
and the reality is that we still have investments to make as part of executing and building the supply chain capabilities to deliver on the two thousand and eighteen targets we just talked about so
these statements are based on how we see things today actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our ten-q -- ten-k and ten-q filings
while also returning significant cash to our shareholders since we began this journey three years ago
we also reduced overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other tools and we're beginning to institutionalize our approach to cost management
in sum we're pleased with our overall financial performance in twenty fifteen as well as with the excellent progress we made in the transformation
as you saw in our press release today effective at the end of the fourth quarter we deconsolidated our venezuela operations and we began to account for our investments in venezuela using the cost method of accounting in our gaap financial statements
but it's no secret that two thousand sixteen is expected to be another challenging year on slide sixteen you can see various issues that are affecting all categories not just ours
as an investor in jde we remain very confident in the long-term potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for its shareholders
maybe slide twelve today is this something you might be willing to do again at some point regarding two thousand and eighteen's margin i'm just trying to get a better idea of specifically which line items grow when sense of timing and so forth
there is an inherent risk that our actual results could differ materially you can find our disclosures about risk factors that can potentially contribute to such differences in our ten-k which we are filing today
the rosewood miramar beach hotel for caruso enterprises the newark airport terminal one in new jersey for the port authority in new york
mainly due to contributions from the newark airport terminal one project and the favorable closeout adjustment on a courthouse project in california
the increase was largely due to contributions from the newark airport terminal one project and the technology project in california
however we believe that our operating cash generation in two thousand and nineteen will be substantially improved and we are again targeting operating cash for the year to be in excess of net income
and the fact of the matter is an owner today is fortunate if he gets two bids
there's never been an instance in my fifty years of consequence that the federal government ever clawed back or was able to claw back committed funds
civil segment revenue was up fourteen percent compared to the fourth quarter of last year primarily as a result of progress on the newark airport terminal one project
and we feel the potential to be concluded in two thousand and nineteen and the real issue will be very candidly whether i'm willing
and really extraordinary if he gets three that's the market we're in having said that we still have our limits physically and intellectually about how much more we can take
and a business that in my opinion increased government spending doesn't affect us because we're simply not going to pursue significant growth in a business that at best generates two percent pretax margins
we are stymied in many areas continue to be and i expect to have a meeting in the next two weeks and try to in some manner determine when we can gear back up
and a very significant amount of our unbilled total as i've said previously and as we reviewed in-house comes due to put it bluntly or i don't know how else to define it in the next twelve months
on the west coast we continue to ramp up our work on purple line section two in los angeles with the construction of the tunnel launch pit commencing in
we continue in negotiations on three major claims have received significant offers on two of them although not adequate
however i would note that while we're pleased with the strong fourth quarter civil margin we don't expect a fifteen percent margin to be the norm at least not yet
i don't even know how we could possibly even handle it there are so many major projects teeing up for the next twelve to eighteen months
when in fact our civil business were anticipating ten percent to twelve percent and potentially increases in that because of the lack of competition
our growing backlog provides the foundation upon which i expect to deliver revenue growth and increased earnings over the next three to five years
we continue to talk we hope to bring those to conclusion over the next ninety days but we have not been able to conclude any as yet
on an annual basis we now expect civil operating margins to be at the upper end of the ten percent to twelve percent margin range that we have historically seen in civil group if not slightly higher
of general and maintenance capital expenditures for two thousand and nineteen in addition keep in mind that for certain of our large civil projects we purchase equipment that is entirely owner funded
in an industry where nobody's left i keep saying it but the truth is in the pudding we have now got three straight
however setting aside washington the truth of the matter is new york state which is one of our two major
let's begin with the quarter we're now about halfway through executing the financial strategy we announced eighteen months ago as this quarter's results show we're making solid progress on key aspects of our plan and we're on track to meet our goals for the year
the strong margin performance in q two has set us up nicely to absorb wage increases and promotions
the full year favorable revenue impact from currency is expected to be approximately sixty basis points
along with other investments in the business in the second half of the year while staying on track to achieve our non-gaap operating margin target of approximately twenty one percent this year
these statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the sec including our form ten-q to be filed later today
in summary our solid execution in q two along with continued investment in the business
in light of both increased competition and our belief that apus is now attracting better quality students with improved persistence and conversion rates
and are included as an exhibit to our current report on form eight-k furnished with the sec earlier today
as well as the opportunity for nursing and healthcare education more broadly and we are pleased by the progress the team at hcn is making to further strengthen the institution for bright future
moving on to page three over the last several years we've remained steadfast in our commitment to affordability while working to stabilize enrollment and prepare our institution for the future
cost savings from the previously announced voluntary reduction in force completed april one are tracking towards the top end of the two thousand eighteen savings range
as a result of various factors including the risk factors described in the risk factor section and elsewhere in the company's most recent annual report on form ten-k
these and other attributes have helped amu to become a leader in serving military and veteran communities
there are currently limited treatment options for this disease and if approved imbruvica would be the first and the only therapy
in addition to rova-t we have four stemcentrx assets in the clinic and we are on track to transition several additional programs into human trials this year
whoever -- whatever biosimilars want to enter this market they're going to have to navigate their way through that IP and i still feel as confident as i did when we communicated that to you back
having said that though i'd say then if you look at two -- three other large categories they have different risks associated with them from a probability of success
earlier this month we presented detailed results from the phase ii study in uterine fibroids at the meeting of the society of endometriosis and uterine disorders
and so that's just an anomaly in the data it's going to correct itself as we lap it and i think actually ims is going to try to correct it at some point here going forward they are publishing
so what we're looking for in trinity is something that really changes that picture something that shows response rates that are
and that exchange had about a thirty basis point impact and obviously exchange rates are going to move around so it's difficult to call how that is in the future so if you back those out
our submission will follow soon thereafter enabling a commercial launch in twenty eighteen in addition to trinity
up to this point we've only competed basically in genotype-one and so there's a big opportunity for us to be able to compete in the other genotypes going forward
i'm not going to speculate on what the right strategy is there i would tell you in the markets that humira competes in
for the purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of one thousand nine hundred ninety five abbvie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statement
later this year we are also expecting additional data readouts from phase ii studies
certainly share buyback is another way to do that but returning cash to shareholders to reward them for the tremendous success that humira has had and will continue to have going forward is a high priority for us
what is represented in this particular account so we can add back that data into the overall market and i'd say generally speaking humira continues to perform just like it has historically in fact if you look at
related to your comments earlier and then the second question just has to do with the line extension behind humira i believe you launched a
our forward-looking statements advisory is found on slide thirteen and the agenda for today's call is on the second slide i'll now turn the call over to chris
strong earnings growth primarily reflects eight percent growth of total revenue and a lower provision for credit losses
primarily reflecting the impact of specific allowances recorded against energy loans in two thousand and sixteen these factors were partially offset within common shareholders' net income
potential revisions to osfi's underwriting guideline b twenty could serve to further curtail market activity and reduce the pace of home price increases across the country
this portfolio has performed very well for us since we started the business in two thousand and four and we expect it to continue to deliver strong results as we remain consistent with our conservative risk appetite and our selective approach to approve new loans
we've -- internally we can support -- organically we can support about ten percent to twelve percent annual loan growth organically just from the earnings that the portfolio generates so it's always been
are able to take that new structure and go to market much more effectively than we could before so our goal is to grow the aum here and if we have great opportunities to add an acquisition to this equation we will absolutely look at that
earnings growth also benefited from a decrease in the provision for credit losses to twenty basis points of average loans compared to thirty two basis points last year
before i move on to complete the outlook for net interest margin i'll stay with cwb optimum mortgage for a moment to tie up the issues we saw a few months ago within the alternative lending space of the canadian housing market
as we've seen the q three results over the last couple of weeks most of the banks have had
given some of the let's call them macro uncertainties that we've seen is there any early preparation for ifrs nine i know you have
the provision for credit losses as well as the level of growth impaired at this stage of a recovery out of an economic recession so that was a portfolio comment and not specific to these two clients
for over ten years geographic diversification opportunities outside of western canada have been sought to significantly enhance our future growth opportunities
could make it more difficult for certain prospective buyers to qualify for uninsured mortgages and have a negative impact on originations within cwb optimum
so if we look back a year or two we had a much larger portfolio of preferred shares and common shares which don't qualify as high-quality liquid assets so there is
another year or two to adopt that before -- the other banks are moving to it more quickly
fair assumption to assume we might see upticks the same in the first two pickups of the bank of canada
this change is a direct result of our balanced growth strategy as a reminder the deposits that we raise through the broker market are entirely fixed-term deposits with terms of maturity between one and five years
we've reduced the balance of this portfolio substantially in the past year and it now represents less than one percent of our total loans we do not expect material credit impacts related to our remaining energy loans going forward
the average price of detached homes softened within parts of the gta during the third quarter
if -- it doesn't look that much different to end q three so should i take your comments earlier to mean that some of the branch deposit growth has been so much stronger that you feel that you can permanently
in the quarter prepayment impact in the quarter contributed about two basis points of the five basis point increase from the second quarter
so we are sticking with the guidance of something around one hundred for the full year needless to change this in just last quarter
although it's not a necessity under ifrs so unlike some of our peers
we're not going to decrease the coverage because we have new npl and i think your last question was about capital consolidated
so make no mistake we'll get on to capital allocation but it isn't going to be in the next month or two months but it'd probably be within -- before the end of the year
that's helpful and then a follow-up if i may on that question when you decided to exit the mobile business in september of 'fifteen you talked about reducing
and it's something that we've certainly started to look at but job one is going to be the -- get the cost structure
so we spend a lot of time on the fy 'sixteen look back and you can see the implications of
when you look at the heart of ic design it's basically your ability to efficiently use silicon
followed shortly thereafter by our ten-q for q one fiscal 'seventeen we will then be current with our required sec filings and compliant with listing requirements of nasdaq
as you all know q one is normally seasonally down from q four of the prior year market expectations
who needs complex ic design to solve their challenges
we have decided to break this up into separate calls for finishing fiscal year 'sixteen and then the first quarter
we still are conducting a search and expect to complete shortly a search for a cfo and a chief accounting officer
over the last ten weeks is the quality of the design capability that we have within the company
i have no doubt in my mind that nothing on the income statement has escaped matt's eye in the last seven days so
but inexorably we're driven to going over fifty percent as a company and that's where our focus is on in this next year
yes and so paul at the risk of you chastising me into giving you other numbers prior to the ten-k being out
i will tell you going -- thinking about last fourth quarter and go two years ago and three years ago
not interested in being the third vendor in a box rfp but there are a couple that
while there are many highlights from the quarter i would like to speak briefly about three we continue to expand our addressable market and broaden our base at a torrid pace
the ceva annual stockholders meeting will be held next week and we encourage all shareholders to participate through casting their proxy votes or attending the event
much better processes in place than we certainly had two years ago as it relates to managing our working capital it is the key emphasis for the business and we also operate under a
facilitated the extension of our abl in the fourth quarter and also helped provide the economic stability we now enjoy so that we can focus on the day-to-day management of our business
that have helped our adjusted ebitda improve dramatically since we began this journey in early two thousand and fourteen now we are pivoting the company to strengthen our partnerships with our customers and suppliers
this team has begun to train all of our approximately four hundred sales associates on a contemporary
so on page seven let's review some of our highlights before we get into the more detailed review of our results
over the last three four years there have been a lot of global commencing factories which have shut down
of results not nine months like in argentina so we don't have a comparison with the previous year because we started now so we are only presenting information for this
from one side the FX losses on our dollar-denominated debt that was compensated with some of our liquidity that was abroad in dollars and some
with the same quarter so far so we will work in the future to identify if we can change this if not we will continue to have a lag of three months but in the middle we have to analyze subsequent events
coupled with our demonstrated ability to manage the expense in capital base we are off to a great start in this game changing combination of these two firms
most importantly these strategies had very little to do with legacy kcg's primary mission of serving customers and has significantly deteriorated more recently in less volatile markets
and share buybacks now i would like to turn to slide five and highlight some recent trends in adjusted net trading income
our results for q three are in the press release and as you can see this quarter in particular was a bit messy
we have been able to manage the capital base sufficiently through capital synergies by combining the businesses however historical capital usage in the legacy kcg business was higher
in the market making segment we will report global equities including america's equities and rest of the world and global ficc fixed income currencies and commodities this aligns much better with how we manage the segment
given this tough period and the various purchase accounting adjustments required by gaap in light of that complexity we are providing an extensive earnings presentation
legacy kcg had at least three independent trading systems in addition to separate back office platforms that were largely disconnected
we will provide data to demonstrate this fact in a few slides but legacy kcg operated certain prop quant-driven strategies that took relatively more risk
this differs from the reported number because of the first twenty days of july before the transaction closed
in addition to the numerous growth opportunities from the combined firms we remain excited by our growth opportunities in asian equities in particular and the opportunities presented to us in europe as a result of mifid ii if
before i do that i want to summarize what we have accomplished in the three months since this transaction has been closed
and so there was just a number of instances around the firm where capital was being deployed very very inefficiently again it goes back to differences of the two firms
i would like to provide an early progress report on the integration as we said on our last call we hit the ground running on day one with our detailed plan that we developed ahead of the deal closing
first the legacy kcg wholesale market making and virtu market making businesses are extremely complimentary and symbiotic and we were mainly excited about the numerous
joe thank you doug i will now continue with the earnings presentation of our results slides eight and nine present a snapshot of how we will report results as a combined company
we're running today smarter fx strategies thanks to i'll say the quant genius of some of the kcg guys we got some really talented
we are providing this information to enable investors to perform a more meaningful comparison of our operating results in a manner similar to management's analysis of our business lastly this call is also being webcast and a replay will be available on our website for two weeks and
so if you really look at these three products while i cannot talk to you about the immediate relative contribution but i can speak to you in the -- when the product cycles are fully set in
the recent executive order authorizing the construction of the keystone xl pipeline is expected to have a very positive impact on our markets
even before the news of the pipeline we were seeing encouraging employment data in all of our markets since our last conference call in october the unemployment rate has declined in all three states that we operate in
as well as a new financial reporting system and a new hr or human resources system
today's conference is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the conference over to allison cain of icr you may begin
we have twelve million shares remaining from the current authorization and will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises and based on the internal valuation of the stock
please note that during our call today we will refer to these non-gaap results as adjusted sales and volume i will now turn the call over to jim snee thank you nathan good morning everyone
muscle milk ready-to-drink protein beverages performed well especially in the food drug and mass channels our muscle milk powder business was softer this quarter which is in line with the category dynamics
we expect growth in the foodservice channel to remain strong with growth coming from many of our brands such as hormel bacon one and hormel fire braised meats
in foodservice items such as hormel bacon one fully cooked bacon and hormel pepperoni delivered excellent growth during the quarter
in addition our new muscle milk bars have been well received in the marketplace
proactively managing our own business by taking further reductions in half one so we're doing the right things to set ourselves up for improvement
well not lose market share in the different segments or is that something you would try to maintain in terms of spending what we had two q throughout the rest of the year
recent twelve weeks scanned data shows positive sales trends as the jennie-o brand continues to outperform the category
can you just help us understand your base case for 'seventeen is that
as you can see from the www graphs
we'll probably for the first time over the next six to twelve months are going to be in a position to run this mine at a steady state albeit at a reduced tonnage the reduced tonnage obviously doesn't help
very pleasing to see that we were able to move through that same problem area but done on level two in
in order to compete operators are reallocating investments away from traditional it and back-office solutions into new solutions that leverage and optimize new technologies
tied to foreign currency movements such that our eps guidance remains unchanged for the year
and that helps to add value so when you look at telstra when you look at mtn when you look at some of the others
it's an exciting time and at the same time a challenging time earlier this year i laid out three key objectives aimed at helping our company realize its full potential over the long term
also we will discuss certain financial information that is not prepared in accordance with gaap we believe that these non-gaap financial measures when reviewed in conjunction with our gaap financial measures
much like mtn south africa is having us do for them with both their wholesale and residential businesses
these two items are fundamental to our policy of returning cash to our shareholders and we remain firmly committed to continuing them
targeted operating range of eighteen percent to twenty percent we continue to believe this range provides a good mix of returns to the bottom line while still providing investment opportunities to grow our business
which we will refer to during the call are available on the ir section of our website as well as on our iphone and ipad applications
growth in hydraulics was down seventeen percent as volume in our demolition shares is correlated to pricing levels in the scrap steel market
the core sfs principles require agility to respond when business conditions change
with us having a continued headwind going into twenty sixteen we will continue to be prudent about our approach in that area and go after specific price actions where it makes sense
aggressively pursuing commodity deflation and other pricing opportunities to partially mitigate this impact it will position us to demonstrate continued operating leverage in two thousand and sixteen as well as reasonable earnings growth
price going forward to the extent we're going to talk about it for 'sixteen and then jim i think he'll give you a little deeper dive on industrial and our thoughts
this was the fifth consecutive quarter of organic growth at or above six percent for the company on a combined basis
with six percent organic growth and record operating margin levels that expanded seventy basis points
this shows me that we are on track to reach cash flow breakeven and gaap income this year
we also have hired five new industry experienced sales reps and had a very strong first quarter of sales bookings that will lay the groundwork of strong future growth
every six to eight weeks for all of our existing and future customers our phones themselves basically do what the platform tells it to do
our gaap numbers also improved and would have been even better except for
in addition we continue to manage our cost and improve our bottom line as we get closer to cash flow breakeven and gaap profitably
we had great excitement in our partner channel program during the quarter adding sixteen new partners for the quarter and that momentum has continued into q two with very strong partner additions
to improve those metrics we have added a new vp of sales and a new director of sales to head up our dealer partners and direct sales groups
we get it done in six eight ten weeks and we get the deal so we're seeing more of that as we go forward
in line with the sector we have seen an increase in the npl formation in the second quarter the increase was mainly due to the two big ticket commercial files
thanks to new products like the cool-fit range launched end of last year
the difference between orders and sales has to do with production lead times as a lot of orders were booked in the last three months
so we can remain on schedule for filing the accelerated approval application with fda i am pleased with the approval and hope to be able to announce completion of this in the near future
building inventories for a potential launch for the TNBC there are certainly parties we are talking to that are capable
i think it's misleading to give percentages because when you have thirty to forty patients three or four patients can make a big difference in percentages but i think if
and so one three oh is a very attractive one that many of our investigators are very anxious for us to expand beyond colorectal cancer
in my presentation that we have already three adcs we have an immuno-oncology program and because of our great desire to capitalize on these other opportunities
the recent offering of stock and warrants gives us the flexibility to initiate the confirmatory trials and continue other developments of immu-a thirty two without interruption
in early two thousand and seventeen we also have other new and interesting investigational products that we are going to be presenting at medical conferences
the sooner we do a partnering deal the better it is for the entire company and its plans one thirty two is moving forward and we will not delay
i'm pleased to report that our target of enrolling the additional forty-or-so patients this fall continues and we should complete this process shortly
a reconciliation to comparable gaap measures is available with our earnings release
as i said earlier however the growth in ebitda was modest due to continued margin pressures primarily from cost of sales and restaurant labor expense
now to delivery have you seen anything from a competitive standpoint as far as that impacting markets where you compete with some of the bigger qsr burger guys
in terms of -- and i also think that the sense is that by the three major players continuing
overall we had a mixed performance during the third quarter although we achieved strong growth on the top line our growth in adjusted ebitda was more modest as we continued to experience margin pressures
yes all right understood and then the last one for me is as i think about the 'eighteen ebitda guidance it would seem to imply a return to store margin expansion
fiscal 'nineteen and beyond has a chance to grow at a pretty accelerated rate based on the cagrs that you've talked about in the past
and we are looking at taking several steps to restructure this business and we'll update you when we meet again for the q four result
so this combination of three investments that we are making will help us substantially increase the cake milling capacity
supported by low prices across several commodities as i had alluded earlier and also due to seasonality going ahead in q four and q one which are historically our high procurement quarters we expect
up to twenty one million bales as compared to fourteen million bales of last year and we also believe that we will
is poised to end this year above the ten million tonnes of trading volumes and that is contributing to the overall increasing volumes at the portfolio level
two additional quick service restaurants were added in april and we took over operation of one more from a former tenant
mild temperatures during the two thousand and sixteen quarter had a negative impact on truck service despite the stronger oil change business this quarter versus the two thousand and fifteen first quarter
will be inconsistent with first quarter two thousand and sixteen however as you know fuel margins can be sensitive to competitive and market factors
we branded or we're in the process of branding gasoline offerings at seventeen locations
already since that closing about two weeks ago we've acquired one former franchise location and we expect a new franchise location to open later this week
i'm looking forward to the balance of two thousand sixteen the combination of prospects we have for continued ramp-up from integration of our recent acquisitions in the convenience store and restaurant space
regarding depreciation and amortization expense we believe that the first quarter amount is a reasonable run rate estimate for an average remaining two thousand sixteen quarter
for a number of reasons that we fully explained in our press release and in our form ten-q to be filed later today
approximately seventy five percent of this increase in site level operating expenses was due to newly acquired sites for which operating expenses are fully loaded into our results very soon after acquisition
and you also are increasingly big in c-stores both of which almost everything trades at a higher multiple than you guys seem to trade on an ebitda basis
thanks jeff before i provide commentary on our financial results for the fourth quarter of twenty eighteen it's important to note the fourth quarter of twenty seventeen included a royalty settlement related to a license agreement
we actually grew in our largest customer in twenty eighteen but it wasn't on mobile it was on all the other products and i think as we start going in and i took a look at this harsh
similar utilization rates in the second half of this year versus what you had in the second half of 'eighteen or was there any
can be found in our press release posted on our website at knowlescom including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures
for full year twenty eighteen we were pleased to deliver eleven percent top line growth with strong operating leverage ahead of the expectations we had in the beginning of the year and well above the growth rates we saw in most of the end markets we serve
my comparisons to fourth quarter twenty seventeen amounts have been adjusted to exclude the impact of the settlement
all financial references on this call will be on a non-gaap continuing operations basis unless otherwise indicated
to come back for you and start growing in two q or would it be just that the -- you expect the iot business to start ramping and maybe there are parts and pieces of the mobile business that come up
but we're going to have to see how successful those products are so i would say overall the breadth is pretty good the pipeline is full and that two percent to four percent stands
even though we started billing all clinics direct for medicare patients effective july one we were still processing and collecting
this amendment will be filed on form eight-k in the next several days it provides for improved required maximum leverage covenant levels under the original agreement the leverage covenant maximum level
that we didn't have a relationship with before and so our seventeen hundred locations i always talk about could be everything from a
note that the current year included six months of medicare competitive bidding price reduction
now two thousand seventeen finds us with the largest market share the company has ever had no longer subject to medicare pricing risk
for home infusion companies billing drugs under part d when there is an immediate and significant reimbursement cut
this comes from more and more people being exposed to the c series' in-service performance
improving cash flows for the balance of the year are expected to come from seasonally stronger patterns at bt
and we see a clear path to the upper half of our ebit guidance
on the aerospace side volumes were consistent with market demand on all programs while c series started contributing modestly to top line with six deliveries
near the level recorded in q two last year as globals represented a greater share of our overall deliveries
for both c series models in the third quarter this means better operating costs and value for airlines
with that i will turn it over to john to review the q two financial results
and we are very confident about the future of the global seven thousand moving forward so all in all
we settled some claims in q one of this year that relates to the past
is very demanding from a last mile standpoint and this works to tfi's advantage which we think you'll see more clearly with our new segmentation
came out of the system it went all the way slowly every day with less and less until the end of march so by q two of this year
greg is transitioning out of the cfo role and a few quarters ago you made some general comments about overall succession planning in the organization
okay -- q one logistics side has been difficult because of the tightness of the trucking market so yes we lost a little bit of revenue in our logistics division but not in our last mile
but that being said what's important is we've also added a lot of executives over the course of the last twelve months
we have completed our first round of investments now in belgrade we were down there last week -- two weeks ago
we don't want to give you exactly the figures on that one but you need to trust us that the order intake in this area has been very solid in q four and continue to look very promising also for the running quarter
we hope with the federal announcement and the solid q one performance we can put most of these issues behind us
our reporting this quarter was delayed a few days in order to finalize our results under the new six oh six revenue recognition standards while the numerical changes are relatively minor the work required was not
we believe that our receivable portfolio is of high quality and that dso will trend down in the second quarter
in our products group our emerald kvm product line is getting traction in the market and supports our excitement for its future this was a big step in the products strategic plan to develop proprietary product lines in key targeted markets
what i've done is extended an offer to extend the current agreement for twelve months to give us time to rebuild some trust between the parties to give us time to get these pilots out into the workplace to make sure that they prove out and they do what we think they're going to do
the team recognized this opportunity and moved quickly we went from conception to completion and moving traffic in less than ninety days
our recent joint venture with lhc group brings our company to another level of focus on home health and hospice and enhances our opportunity to grow this portion of our business
when adjusted to exclude both providence as well as the reduction to revenue associated with the lhc transaction
as well as the impact of the previously discussed decline in surgical volumes and the impact of the lhc transaction
but it does seem to be spreading out a little bit more over the course of the last two or three quarters and i think it's important to recognize that we expected this creep this creep from urban markets into more rural markets
and we expect several more facilities to achieve this designation in twenty seventeen in addition
from reductions in readmissions and forty basis points from certain lower acuity admissions such as births
in the first quarter of two thousand seventeen as compared to the same quarter of the prior year and as a percentage of total revenue
that was caused by our fourth quarter implementation as a new clinical it system at our conemaugh health system in pennsylvania
agencies and business lines into the partnership over the balance of the year there's one and then there's two more that will occur
in the ten-k but it looks like it moderates in 'eighteen versus 'seventeen i'm just wondering if there's any other kind of moving parts that you can make us aware of
as well as one additional month of the providence health system that we acquired effective
excluding the impact of this charge in the first quarter of the prior year our other operating expenses improved seventy basis points primarily as a result of lower acquisition-related legal and consulting fees
during the first quarter of two thousand and seventeen the prior owner successfully negotiated the settlement of these matters at amounts that were less than previously estimated as a result our exposure to those matters was eliminated
as a percentage of revenues consolidated salary wages and benefit costs increased by fifty basis points
and so you can see there'll be a ramp on free cash flow over the balance of the year we also have q two and q four are periods where we will see
and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation we intend to limit the length of this call to one hour
and now moving to slide eighteen and our outlook we are maintaining an outlook
we've got about -- if i remember right forty percent of our loans kind of in the near term are impacted by the change in rate
we experienced about three basis points of margin headwind during the past year due to a two percentage point lower concentration of loans relative to earning assets
to the state tax rates nonetheless we feel comfortable giving an outlook that the two thousand and eighteen effective tax rate is likely to be
the higher salaries and bonuses paid to many of our employees and also contemplates the effect of the december two thousand and seventeen increase in the fed funds rate although it does not assume any further increases in net or other benchmark interest rates
if you exclude the single commercial credit that was subject to a department of justice investigation in the first quarter or nine basis points if you include that credit
the securities yield declined slightly this was primarily due to higher premium amortization on the sba or small business association loans
turning to slide five i've already highlighted the efficiency ratio in my earlier comments but visually this represents all the work we've done since twenty fourteen to improve the profitability of the company
however this may -- will be offset by the effect of tax reform and its impact on the municipal loan and securities portfolio yield which we estimate to be about three basis points of headwind to the net interest margin
and this is presented alongside our effective tax rate and the third bar for two thousand and seventeen excludes items such as the expense associated with the revaluation of the deferred tax asset taken in the fourth quarter
we are fully committed to continuing to achieve positive operating leverage we have three years behind us in our effort to materially improve profitability and grow earnings we remain committed to further improvement and simplification of our operational processes
back in two thousand and fifteen we indicated that we were going to be targeting much more substantial returns on capital that could
and i would say that compared to five or six years ago the investments we're making on the technology side are much more offensive and forward-leaning
and in this case contract year one which ended on february twenty nine these modifications included changes to certain performance benchmarks specified in the contract
of fiscal year two thousand and sixteen these modifications are expected to lower our future revenue run rates
we believe that this contract will yield operating income margins in our typical range of ten percent to fifteen percent in future years
we've also continued to receive many questions related to specific performance indicators under the haas contract
many states are choosing to manage this important process and maximus has played an integral role for supporting these efforts
we still expect our tax rate to run between thirty seven percent and thirty nine percent but more towards the lower end of that range
there's also been speculation within the investment community that the haas contract was under review for cancellation or significant changes i want to dispel that myth today we maintain a collaborative working relationship with our client
our work can provide a credentialing that started more than a decade ago our portfolio has since grown to include six contracts along with a healthy pipeline of additional opportunities
the general trend in ltss has been to ensure that individuals are in the right setting and receiving the right level of support and care
we recently broadened our ltss capabilities through the acquisition of ascend based in tennessee ascend is one of the largest health assessment providers on behalf of us government agencies
think about years two and three i know you talked about a lower revenue trajectory can you be a little more specific perhaps about
we did hold a webinar two days ago and i was really proud that we were kind of first to market in that regard with a very comprehensive webinar held in conjunction with
what was your previous revenue expectation for the haas contract for
if that's new business driving the increase or reprocurement i know there's some comments there that over fifty percent is new i'm wondering how that also compares to
from one state which was responsible for dsos of three days
also known as haas as rick mentioned certain features of the haas contract have been modified to better align with the client's programmatic objectives
to this end we've had personal assurances from dwp that the secretary of state has not expressed concern over the continuity of the haas contract
i view it as a better risk profile we really do have a more stable footing for both the client and maximus with these revisions
i would lump them largely into four categories one is the area of beneficiary support services
feeling of confidence with respect to fy 'sixteen guidance and that's why we were able to really manage it manage the bottom end of our guidance up and effectively raise the midpoint
let me focus my health segment commentary today on our haas contract
the financial impact from the haas contract modifications had an immediate pickup
acquired revenue growth from acentia was offset by expected organic declines in the legacy maximus business as we mentioned last quarter
the segment was unfavorably impacted by a five percent decline from foreign currency translation
income and earnings in the second half of fiscal year two thousand and sixteen are expected to be driven by the steady operational and financial progress of certain programs in start-up
further there is no current plan on making substantial changes or terminating the haas contract some of the modifications that were made to our contract were done in parallel with the government spending review
separately dwp has confirmed with us that the secretary of state is focused on potential changes to the fit for work contract
the vessel ended the year completing the first well of a four-well campaign for another client
last year the market provided strong support for the utilization of our two vessels
the roam will be available for the second half of the year we do have opportunities for it again we've just been conservative and not added that to our guidance
does that improve the profitability of the vessel meaningfully for the twenty eighteen time frame
have over a rig coming in on a low day rate spending five days to mobilize this equipment and then starting against the efficiencies that we used to have
any significant variation from these key assumptions could cause our ebitda to fall outside of the range provided
highly variable seasonal swing for robotics as we roll out of q one into the rest of the year if q one is going to be
affordable housing represents a significant opportunity for fleetwood and the exclusive supply agreements with the two major operators are expected to contribute strong forward volume
you'll notice there that we've separated manufactured accommodation from village operations and we've done this because those two income streams really have different attributes from an investment point of view
so if you just like to turn to slide four now and if we just consider the underlying results for a moment you'll see how fleetwood's results have moved over the last four years and while i mentioned revenue and ebit a moment ago
along with the discontinued operation that i'll speak about in a moment the three business streams were previously grouped as one segment called manufactured accommodation
now we shouldn't underestimate the significance of this agreement because at the end of the mining boom we saw a major reduction in revenue and earnings in wa
we encourage you to review the company's annual and quarterly public filings on sedar or on the company's website
long beach in particular has been showing healthy sales after starting commercial operations on february one of this year and we continue to see several opportunities where we are well positioned to compete with for significant projects
while foreign exchange rates are less favorable than in twenty fifteen they remain very advantageous
through the balance of twenty sixteen we expect to spend relatively modest maintenance capex for orca and our terminals
construction activity month-over-month has shown steady improvement since the start of the year according to data from dodge work continues to translate funding from the fast act into activity on the ground but the impact to-date has been negligible
in addition the underlying price increases achieved in twenty fifteen as well as our expectations for volumes this year have positioned us well even if the canadian dollar continues to appreciate against the dollar
technical work is underway and our current goal is to be in a position to share the results in mid-twenty sixteen we are very confident about this project
and will allow us to quickly progress the project through twenty sixteen we are also focused on developing this new project with the same care and consideration we apply to our orca quarry in concert with our first nation partners
thank you darren as noted earlier this year q one was expected to be slow with wet weather impacting construction activity across california
there were multiple reasons for this development also in q four which we will elaborate later and which have also made us to think about the new program that is needed in the business
and then maybe one still more on the actions you're taking now the savings actions are you looking to exit any
i just wanted to explain how we've reported our results for two thousand and eighteen we have updated our operating segments to reflect the new structure of management reporting following the lagan acquisition
an increase in underlying ebit will be offset by increased depreciation and interest costs
and the other question on that was with one million tonnes of production do you produce about one million tonnes of carbon or just over
we have successfully applied big data and ai technology throughout the user journey for our user acquisition
with respect to our operating plan for two thousand seventeen i'd like to share with you a few of our key priorities first
started being allocated to the international segment in the fourth quarter of two thousand and sixteen as well as wage and other inflationary increases and higher bad debt
as i mentioned earlier two thousand and sixteen was a challenging year for this part of the business but our client relationships and reputation in this space
in addition we provide services to international investment market clients to allow them to comply with applicable sec regulations and we also provide language solutions to international clients
as dan mentioned we're happy with the improved activity levels in the broader market that took place postelection and the resulting impact we have seen in the first two months of the year
okay your press release could do a better job of breaking out the segment it's paying a lot of attention to non-gaap accounting versus gaap but
we did however see market activity and deal announcements start to pick up postelection leading to our own activity increasing in the first two months of two thousand and seventeen given the normal deal cycle
in our first five months as a standalone company we have also begun to identify potential growth opportunities where we can leverage our core compliance and process management capabilities along with our breadth of long-standing client relationships to serve new markets
and lower volume of compliance works in the fourth quarter of two thousand and sixteen investment markets reported
given this positive feedback in conjunction with the actions we are taking there are exciting opportunities ahead of us at the same time i recognized that two thousand sixteen was clearly a difficult year
we've also made significant progress in our first five months toward operating on a standalone basis
prior to the spin certain costs for resources of the business were not recorded directly in our operations but instead were recorded centrally at rr donnelley and allocated for the company in the carve-out financial statements
in capital markets we provide compliance products and services to companies that are subject to the filing and reporting requirements of the sec
at this point march activity also looks to be trending similarly to the strong start for the year so early indications for two thousand and seventeen are positive but much of the quarter's performance will be driven by what we see in the next thirty one days
vending signings are up over fifty percent for the year and while it takes time for signings to turn into revenues they are a good indicator of future growth prospects and share capture
we've been looking for the right expansion opportunity for quite a while and we were excited to find an excellent partner in tac
was going to be down double digits for the quarter and march is the first month for the quarter so yes government took a step down from the q two levels
a moment on ais which has generally performed in line with expectations over the course of the past three quarters since our acquisition of this oem fastener business
of our guidance by about forty basis points on the base business on the top line that was
before getting into the details let me remind you that we had provided q two guidance for both our total company results and our base business or total company excluding the impact of the ais acquisition
i don't know if that's taking longer or if i'm not remembering it correctly but now it sounds like you're only talking about all the efforts adding one point to growth versus where we are now so could you just clarify that please
in the third quarter of twenty sixteen garden city medical is included in the twenty sixteen results that will be discussed on the call unless otherwise noted
for an explanation of the items considered to be non-gaap financial information that will be discussed on today's call
look out there there's maybe something between nothing and just the tenth quarter long-term view that we'll get our heads around
in shareholders meeting on august twenty three we also
in the nordic segment and in the german segment france has a calendar effect of roughly one day in that quarter
as you see over the years we have the speed between two percent and four percent in shortening of avlos and the last quarter for the
any substantial costs in connection with the three organization this is more
in strengthening the balance sheet since the company went public four years ago
this momentum has continued into twenty eighteen driven by a great back-to-school season where we picked up wins that benefit our education facilities as well as our sports businesses
we're improving our product offerings service and technology across all four of these dimensions to consistently elevate the customer experience
our growth efforts are yielding results beyond our food business in two thousand and seventeen we stood up a separate management team for our facilities business we're making substantial progress
in closing twenty eighteen will be a pivotal year for the company as we drive continued growth in our base business by executing against our strategic imperatives and we also began the integration of two strategic acquisitions
that's the kind of i think growth rate you should expect as we think about twenty eighteen going forward
and certainly as we looked at what we saw happen during the early part of twenty eighteen that has continued
the financial flexibility that we have achieved since the ipo has recently enabled us to take the next step in shareholder value creation
as well as wins across a number of other key sectors we expect our client retention rates to remain strong at the targeted mid-nineties level
i'm encouraged by our progress and the momentum that we have heading into twenty eighteen which is a real tribute to the strength and commitment of our entire organization
as i look back on our performance in twenty seventeen our operating results for the full year and the fourth quarter were right where we expected them to be
as aoi was flat in the quarter because of the natural disaster impact we just mentioned the increase was driven by lower interest and taxes
through two strategically sound and financially compelling acquisitions of avendra and the ameripride announced last month
in fact our results in the fourth quarter reflect the resiliency of our portfolio as we delivered a ten percent increase in adjusted earnings per share
across lines of business and geographies in fact we're entering twenty eighteen with one of the best years of net new business performance in the company's history which gives us confidence in the revenue growth within our multiyear framework
as the higher levels of excess tax benefits related to the equity awards from the ipo have now been recognized
entering this year and over the course of the year than we were in twenty seventeen we feel very confident in that
in health and wellness i'm proud to report that we are well ahead of our targeted goals in our healthy for life twenty by twenty campaign with the american heart association
perhaps an attainable target anymore is that fair or are there some factors in 'eighteen that can still get you to the a hundred basis points
played out in q four and that was q four was going to be the first year -- first quarter where we saw growth for the company for the enterprise within the framework which we did
i think if you look back even as far back as last year at our ipo we said we had a number of levers that we'd pull
comparing the third quarter twenty seventeen to the same period in twenty sixteen average loans grew eight percent excluding the healthcare loan book which i will discuss in more detail in a moment
having said this you should expect the fourth quarter to be in a similar range as this past quarter and then bump up in two thousand and eighteen looking at the individual line items salaries and employee benefits increased from q two due to a couple of new hires
as i said on the call we do believe that we can hold our nim going forward for a couple of reasons one is just
importantly we continue to increase the number of loan relationships in which we are the lead lender or arranger transactions that we lead have increased by thirty nine percent since
what we don't have clear visibility on is when the individuals holding these securities will decide to exercise but we do expect they will occur in twenty eighteen let's move on to the capital
what it does mean though is we have a very viable option given the maturity of this sky
in the services business in the last three years so it's part of the strategic plan of the company so
today we will review our financial and operational results and provide commentary on our performance in the context of our four-point growth strategy
including our entirely new church management capabilities that we built natively using our sky platform
but also quantify the value of improving their performance and refer them to specific tools inside of the raiser's edge nxt to drive growth
with most of that being ratable at this point with ninety percent of our business being recurring that's going to take a bit of time for that to turn into revenue and again it was q two bookings
are ten brand-new modules from scratch using the sky platform that are the modules that run the operations of the church
space as you heard this morning is a game changer for churches and a massive opportunity for blackbaud we also continue to execute against our four-point growth strategy
like the customer reference i mentioned in my prepared remarks just that one customer is going to be able to replace eleven vendors and so we came after this in a little bit of a different way because of
so you can think of it and you've heard us talk a lot about the k-twelve market over the years where we traditionally had fundraising and financials and digital marketing and payments and analytics and we added
please refer to our most recent form ten-k and other sec filings for more information on those risks
our sky business intelligence reporting capability our payment services for credit card transaction processing
the solutions that run the schools that was through an acquisition a little over four years ago this is equivalent in that it is the modules that run the operations of the churches but we built it from scratch in sky
and when those are live because they're in sky there is no integration work to do
the tax credit in two thousand and fifteen derives from the settlement of a number of historic tax issues
we also completed the fund merger of national provident life into phoenix life assurance in the first half of this year leaving only two remaining uk life companies
given the progress we have made over the past two years we are well placed to access the markets at an appropriate time
however it is important to remember that the amount shown here after two thousand and twenty do not include any benefit from management actions
and continuing to the right we can show the various uses of that cash over the period through two thousand and twenty as can be seen
however should a cap be introduced we do not expect the impact to be material given around eighty percent of our customers have no exit charge
specific management actions achieved include the acquisition of a portfolio of equity lease mortgages and further benefits from the full implementation of the mg-alfa system
and so there are two ways that while we're doing an acquisition we'd like to be able to advertise that we have better coverage because of enhanced cash flows and that they are attenuated they go out further years that's why it was important for us to take that
the wholesale business from gibson gibson has provided some sort of guidance range of ebitda that they expect from that business
and that's just a bit less than fifty percent almost as much as the weather
this increase was primarily due to contribution from canwest and higher gross profits in canadian propane distribution usrf and the other services segment
is anticipated to be consistent to modestly lower than twenty seventeen primarily due to the anticipated impact of increases in electricity mill rate
very aggressive when we go out and we want to be realistic so two to four looks extremely good and kind of
and then beth maybe you can just comment on the balance sheets and your guidance of ending the year at three x to three point four times does that include an assumption for executing on
the share is up three percentage points year-on-year the main driver is the inflow of large ticket jobs in the middle east
our perception of the market under the current situation discuss the progress on the medium-term business plan being executed for the last six months and finish my presentation with future forecast
or as lng after cooling and compression process
this is the same slide as the one used during the mtbp meeting in may this year
the company opened a both in recent ceatec and attracted a great attention
fiscal year 'eighteen first half results were characterized by strong positive growth on both sales and the profits the main content is as shown here
we are poised to deliver on the promise of the product category we anticipated when launching durafit our objectives in two thousand and seventeen in this market segment are to continue to grow the durafit brand and support the market penetration of our new downstream partners
and we expect to conclude agreements with others during the balance of twenty seventeen our current program time lines with these customers would result in initial revenue during q four of this year
in the second half of twenty seventeen with that i will turn the call back over to matthew
we look forward to keeping you updated as we execute our strategy during the balance of twenty seventeen and beyond
okay so those will be a drag on margins in 'seventeen but you'd expect that component of the business to see expanding margins further out as volumes pick up
through existing partners alone cdti's technology has the potential to be deployed in two million vehicles per year
as well some of the financial metrics presented on this call today are non-ifrs measures and as such do not have a standardized meaning and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures by other companies
effective jan one but there may also be other areas of pricing that are not as easy to lead but certainly we are of the view that the industry will respond rationally
including the requirement to use the posted five-year mortgage rate published by the bank of canada to determine borrower debt service ratios on all insured loans after october seventeen this year
based on further clarifications provided by the department of finance regarding the grandfathering of mortgages originated prior to november thirty we revised our estimate and now anticipate a twenty five percent to thirty five percent reduction
of beyond the max you would probably only need to look for a property between five percent to ten percent cheaper and that we felt was more doable
the call will be available online for approximately forty five days following today
generally speaking portfolio quality today is significantly improved over the 'oh seven 'oh eight time period and should produce less performance volatility in a similar economic downturn
the comment period with respect to the draft advisory ended on october twenty one and
so we took perhaps a somewhat conservative view there is definitely upside to our estimate but we believe that those people have a greater chance of finding a cheaper property than those people who would look for as much of a twenty percent discount in the price
our specific markets above the osfi prescribed threshold so there is potential that you could see markets being added to the supplementary capital you could see markets that no longer require it
we've been monitoring oil-exposed regions very closely over the past eighteen months and although oil prices have seen some stability since the beginning of the year we recognize that these areas have sustained significant job losses
we expect our new insurance written will stabilize around that level with potential for modest growth over the next twelve to eighteen months
paul the best answer would be jan one but obviously it depends on how the industry responds there are certain areas that we
we have paid the same amount of dividends for the last four years so irrespective of the level of profitability that we have achieved
that idb is valuing at fair value and we are recognizing that historical value at the moment of our acquisitions so when you compare
with tglt that they were supposed to build and give us some apartments at -- in the other cases
then regarding our debt we commented in the last quarter that we issued debt at the irsa level
in page fifteen we have the rest of the lines of our financial statements so we finished up the operating income
we completed the consolidation of one of our two remaining legacy platforms
i am very pleased with our execution in q three my team delivered strong financial performance
by identifying these requirements that go above and beyond the standard needs of hr and payroll for technology companies we have differentiated our products from the rest of the industry
we completed the migration of ambrose in q one and during the third quarter we completed the accord migration
and it's going to be a combination of the right product with the right value and volume will clearly be an element to that in terms of wse but it's not going to be the end
reconciliation of our non-gaap forward outlook to the most directly comparable gaap measures is not included because material items that affect these measures such as
we are now operating just two platforms with our soi platform
we encourage you to review our most recent public filings with the sec for a more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock
the q three results are the most recent indication of the improvement in the insurance business
as we told you on our q two earnings call we took the next step in the verticalization of our direct channel
but then when we start to look at the wse growth for the third quarter relative to the other quarters this year it seems like it slowed down a little bit
it has not been as robust as we've seen in two thousand and fifteen but it's been fairly steady
our acquisition pipeline has grown over thirty percent since the beginning of the year this allows us to be highly selective in our investments while creating value for our customers and getting paid for this value
with respect to debt one of the great features of our master funding program is our ability to prepay any series of notes within twenty four months prior to maturity without a prepayment penalty
related to accelerated amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the store master funding bonds we prepaid in august
that was virtually unchanged from last quarter the weighted average primary lease term of our new investments continues to be long at approximately eighteen years
we have built this relationship over time and as a result of our fourth transaction with them they are now in our top ten as of the end of third quarter we had nineteen vacant properties thirteen of which are gander mountain properties
the portfolio remains extremely diverse by design with our largest tenant representing less than three percent of rent and interest
since the end of the third quarter we have released eight of those and sold one and we have pending resolution on two more of the gander assets
the decrease between years related mainly to the three noncash charges i've just discussed
all completed by the end of twenty seventeen is that what we should have in our numbers and second question just around some of the tax implications that were talked about earlier in the year
our fluid power platform which is more dependent on oem end markets is also under top line pressure in the current macro environment
thanks rob as we've said two thousand and fifteen was a year that presented us with a number of challenges and i'm pleased with the ability of our team to adapt to current conditions while continuing to drive our long-term strategy
was a very dramatic impact in that segment which rippled through to four percent for the business overall so i think that while
expect the margin to be more stable over the course of twenty sixteen or are you going to -- how
and then ramp up during the course of the year to get to that -- the outlook that rob provided of low end fourfour percent so we'd be flat
this was compounded by an already difficult comparison with four fewer operating days
i'd like to briefly discuss the key drivers by segment in the fourth quarter and provide some insights into our plans for two thousand and sixteen beginning with aerospace
and i wanted to touch on the black hawk program for a second i'm looking at the fiscal 'seventeen budget and a shift down in production i know it's just a proposal at this point but
up to foursix percent so we do see some sequential improvement throughout the course of the year i think that's predominantly going to be in the second and third quarters
while we are not expecting an improvement in some of our weaker end markets in two thousand and sixteen we do expect volume to stabilize in the first half and show modest improvement in the second half as comps become easier
finally we are progressing with our integration of extex including a facility move and remain focused on the synergy opportunities with our existing engineered products business
an increase of more than fifty percent that is largely due to the impact of our acquisitions
most of 'sixteen will be focused on integrating the company and we would expect most of those synergies to be
how big of a swing do you expect as you go from q one to q four shannon we expect that we should have a sequential improvement from the
in addition we expect to discuss certain financial measures and information that are non-gaap measures
as we look forward to the year ahead we are anticipating record volume and ebitda in aerospace
while our current bearing manufacturing business is aligned with grw through a focus on solving the critical problems
these actions position us to recognize modest sequential margin expansion in the first quarter of two thousand and sixteen at distribution and we expect to see improved margin result
this should stabilize as we begin to deliver aircraft in early two thousand seventeen in addition we have essentially completed the new zealand sh-two program ending the conversion of that inventory to cash
and we think there will likely be some level of carryover budget for multiyear eight so we're not expecting to see
fourth quarter to the first quarter but it will be relatively modest because a number of the actions that we took during late 'fifteen those costs will flow into 'sixteen as well so
we're going to have faster top line growth than last year's twenty percent and i think it's fair to say by anybody's standard when you see it you will consider it to be very much faster
as a result of the acceleration in the fourth quarter we ended the year with over ten thousand supplier connections
i think it's important to appreciate and we talked about infrastructure two years ago and it was very important to us that we have a level of infrastructure that would support a faster growth rate
i know that when we chat a year from now that we'll all be pleased looking back at how 'seventeen turned out
so what you'll see going forward is eighty-plus percent of revenue increases in dollars becomes something
so the contribution from all of this will move into fiscal 'eighteen but it ought to give us another
there's five issues i'd like to raise for you to take into consideration from this call first
and as you noticed our expenses declined in the last fiscal year fiscal 'sixteen compared to prior years and that's largely because that infrastructural stuff that we did all of that investment
than they would have before in fact there's an interesting incident from one of our hubs that told us that recently that they used to have four people in total doing this kind of compliance work manually
and what that means for us is that we can see a clear path from where we are to over a hundred thousand supplier connections and tens of millions in revenue in the next few years from repositrak alone
lots of hard work blood sweat and tears because we knew it was important to our customer base that we demonstrate the ability to be gaap profitable we certainly did that
looking at each of the traps scanning the number which trap number one one seven three and then if there is a creature in it he has to remove the creature and take a mugshot of the creature
because it is hard for me to imagine if we go out in our time machine one year from today
as we add suppliers as hubs they might only have thirty suppliers
i'm especially pleased with the progress in our ewp segment as engineering a turnaround in this business was one of my first priorities after assuming the coo role last january
our plan is to run it as full as possible on siding but we are retaining the capability to make commodity osb in that plant
i wanted to talk a little bit about input costs and manufacturing costs in osb and i think you've alluded to it by discussing the number of down days
in addition our market share growth has outpaced single-family housing starts since the fourth quarter of twenty sixteen which we believe is in part a strong testament to the high quality and value of our smartside offering
and then our swan valley plant that we converted in two thousand and fifteen it did not run at full capacity
while osb continues to be the largest revenue contributor on a consolidated basis
we will be able to decouple our performance from the commodity cycle that dominates osb we believe that the end result of these focused and deliberate actions will be more consistent and sustainable results over time
we enter twenty eighteen from a position of strength with the opportunity to drive sustainable growth and value to our shareholders
we are transforming lp into a building solutions company and the financial results reflect that change
if the market is good enough you could pretty much run it all the time on siding which i know that's not realistic day one but that's physically possible right
that is correct we've moved it over to the segment january one and the reason we did that was that there are some operating cost expense that goes early into the project
sallie will be referencing these slides in her comments this morning we plan on filing our ten-k later this afternoon and have already filed the eight-k this morning with some supplemental information
in fact it was our strongest year since two thousand and five a meaningful achievement when considering the fact that there were
these factors contributed to improved price realization across our three product segments the recently passed tax reform package is likely to boost investment and consumer spending in the near term
after my first seven months as ceo of LP i am excited and energized by the progress we have made in our outlook for the future
and demographics are improving as millennials transition to their late twenties and enter the phase of life when many begin to think about purchasing a first home
and we wanted to make sure we were capturing that expense in our siding segment rather than osb was one of the reasons we did it sallie may have other things she should mention but
pretty much exclusively going to be making osb this year in the siding segment
we would look -- we would look at be running that new system essentially for around twenty twenty one okay so now i'm not making a statement on the sequence of val-d'or versus cook
these results were driven by lower medical costs as reflected by a sixty basis point improvement in our medical care ratio compared to the first quarter
i'm also happy to report that our rate discussions with the commonwealth have gone well and that we received a rate increase of approximately two and a half percent that
finally we wanted to provide you with ample notice that we are postponing our twenty sixteen fall investor day in september
was effective on july one stepping away from the macroeconomic situation on the island there remains much that is within our control
as disclosed in our ten-q for the first quarter this matter arose as a result of enrollment discrepancies between our health plan in the commonwealth in the early stages of our contract
for twenty sixteen as to where we are in our guidance range but we're less focused on where we are in the guidance range this year and more what are we putting in place
we entered into an agreement with memorial hermann in houston to add this prestigious hospital to our network in two thousand and seventeen finally
and we've seen increased momentum during quarter four last year which encouragingly has continued into this year
it's been a busy three months since our strategy presentation and i'm very pleased to be here today
our initial catchment and focus group research identified three key demographic groups that were heavily represented in the catchment and whom our masterplan approach needed to actively and effectively target
so why are we so confident in our retail positioning i wanted to reflect back on two slides from our strategy presentation in december the first of them we believe community shopping centers
we now have a healthy and growing pipeline of optix and lavante opportunities as clients seek better tools and services to provide insights
to increase ebitda and manage their critical supplier relationships a meaningful differentiator of our analytics and sim tools over other alternatives
effective competitions like the six-month contest with the atlantis trip also helped drive momentum in the second half of the year the result was distribution growth across the board
it's expected that omb will approve the rule and a final regulation will be published in the coming months with implementation expected around year-end
starting on slide six our term life segment experienced strong growth compared with the fourth quarter a year ago
many of the discussions that i've heard of around increased cost or the cost of compliance with bice the need to provide additional information prior to sale
the dol rule either as we understand it today or the discussions of what it might be that put us at a competitive disadvantage such that people would leave our company to go to another company
in twenty seventeen the level of capital deployment may be modestly lower due to several factors
we began the year with positive momentum generated by solid growth in the second half of twenty fourteen our underlying business fundamentals are very strong due to the improvements we've made over the last several years
and ongoing information and so if we operate outside of bice then we don't expect it to be impacted by those
but we did our own and that was an one of our concerns was that the same exam given in four pieces is more difficult to pass than a single exam
on a full quarter basis the ratio of new life insurance licenses to recruits was seventeen point four percent and we expect this ratio to continue to be near this range for the full year twenty sixteen we also expect the ratio
earlier in twenty fifteen we actually got authority from our board to
we are making good progress in delivering the plan we announced on the first of march and the diversification benefit to the group is showing through
in the ib the capital markets environment was pretty robust in the third quarter so we feel good about where we've got to it is part of our key strategy to
for lpl the reduction in corporate tax rates will benefit our financial results and matt will cover this in his remarks
acquired nph stayed disciplined on expenses to drive operating leverage
but we also increased our ica deposit rates by an average of four basis points towards the end of january assuming no further changes in fed rates or our deposit rates
we estimate a net benefit of roughly twelve percentage points from tax reform as the fourteen point reduction in corporate tax rates will be partially offset by some deductions that were eliminated
and then taking that further into ebitda combining with where those assets are going on our platforms the profitability associated with that mix
ria because the regulatory environment gets tougher and that value that we provide from a risk management standpoint
one of our top priorities for two thousand and eighteen is making it easier for advisers and their clients to do business with us
in summary we feel good about the business and earnings growth we delivered in two thousand seventeen we plan to remain focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence
as a result of that and then just -- additionally with the press reporting that finra is thinking about maybe ending
we feel good about the progress we made on our strategic priorities as we grew organically acquired nph and delivered operating leverage while also benefiting from a favorable macro environment
first we generated a benefit of eleven percentage points from tax reform as we are in a net deferred tax liability position and we wrote down those liabilities to the lower rates
our investments for organic growth is just looking at the past few years i think when we've been focused on a bit of a challenging macro environment and really delivering bottom line operating leverage we've been in that zero percent to two percent growth range
i also want to provide an update on our overall asset expectations for nph when
second we had a seven percentage point benefit from our estimated state tax rates from prior years which ended up being lower than what we had estimated
most of the changes that we've made up to this point or all of the changes that we've made up to this point apply to both qualified and nonqualified accounts so even if the sec comes out with something that is not a big pivot for us based on how we've approached it
doesn't really indicate that it's a higher activity level because as you can see from the graph q three of last year
these initiatives are a key part of hbc's future growth and we look forward to realizing the benefits of these investments in the coming quarters
i'm happy to say that in the third quarter we made progress in all three areas
the short answer is this has no impact on us as part of the hbc's effort to highlight the value of its real estate
as well as our performance during the third quarter and year-to-date we remain confident in our ability to execute during the holiday season and into two thousand and sixteen before i conclude i would like to take a moment to thank our associates
this quarter was a very active quarter for hbc as we continue to execute on our strategy for targeted profitable growth
in addition to providing another independent validation of the value of our real estate the proceeds allowed us to pay down our term loan b and further delever hbc's balance sheet
this increase in gross profit dollars was primarily related to the inclusion of hbc europe
i would also like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new associates in germany and belgium who recently joined the hbc family
good morning my name is anita and i will be your conference operator today at this time i would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter and full year two thousand sixteen earnings call
with emphasis on the fourth quarter for further reference we've also attached an expanded quarterly appendix at the end of this presentation as well as a full quarterly reconciliation of any non-gaap financial measures used
turning to slide nine we continue to make good progress with expenses
and increasing duration on the overall investment portfolio during quarter four you can see the spot htm balances at year-end is above the average balance for the quarter as investments were made
starting with slide three while many of you are familiar with butterfield i'd like to provide an overview of the bank
usually on an annual basis starting january one but we've continued to move up and as our
before i turn the call over to michael collins i would like to remind everyone that today's discussion will refer to certain non-gaap measures which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance
in addition we have now started to make premium payments to the bermuda deposit insurance scheme and finally we now have some new costs associated with being a us public company
we continue to operate below the median of comparable us banks due to the relatively lower credit-risk density of our balance sheet
we continue to make excellent headway in support of our strategic plan with the acquisition and seamless integration of hsbc bermuda's private banking investment management and trust business
this facility is being sized and designed to support the anticipated growth we could see for the next ten years
fiscal twenty seventeen turned out to be a pivotal year for us in terms of realizing gains
while some of this was market-driven our results were also significantly influenced by the level of investment we made in our primary businesses to pursue the organic growth objectives we envisioned five years ago
we have seen the volume of collectibles submitted to us for grading increase dramatically in the last twelve months
once completed a new facility will form the hub we need to continue to expand our us business
and the loss of revenue from certain customers in connection with the replacement of our telstar twelve satellite with our telstar twelve vantage satellite early last year
at sixty three degrees west longitude to expand our services over the americas the caribbean and the north atlantic
last month we held our global energy race and perhaps some of you were able to join in among the more than seventy thousand people
and after twenty four months the customers don't have to pay any more
yes with respect to arpa revenue while au arpa is increasing and the
on top of the conventional credit cards on july four we started to accept apple pay on our prepaid cards we will continue to work to improve convenience for customers going forward
the number of total subscriptions on the left grew fourfold in three years to twenty four million since we signed a joint
gross merchandise value of the au economic zone in the first quarter as shown on the left was one point five times what it was a year ago
and had a very strong year in two thousand and fifteen primarily due to continued growth in database and targeted marketing which drove healthy increases in both slot and table games revenue
developments and results may differ from those projected the risks and uncertainties related to these statements are detailed in our filings with the sec during this call we will also discuss non-gaap financial measures
we reference these non-gaap measures because management uses them in part to manage the business and to enhance investor understanding of the underlying trends in our business and to provide better comparability between periods in different years
we are now experiencing some revenue generation synergies from the combination of these two businesses
we also make certain compensation decisions based in part on our operating performance as measured by adjusted ebitda and our credit facility requires us to comply with the consolidated secured leverage ratio that includes performance metrics
represents our highest quarterly performance since the third quarter of two thousand and eight this is a direct result of our continuing commitment to innovate across our product portfolio
and the remainder would relate to general corporate capital expenditures and capex related to our new york lottery business following the recent extension of the agreement for two years
i've discussed already many of the underlying metrics and other expectations in our twenty eighteen outlook however here are a few other items that may assist you in your modeling
while we report our operations in two segments and each of these segments games and payments can be separated and operated independently we do not see ourselves in that narrow context
and the growth of approximately a hundred trial units also set another record at the end of the first quarter
we will be reporting non-gaap adjusted revenue and related measures for the prior-year periods
on the games sales side our e forty three cabinet is gaining solid traction with our customers and helping to drive unit sales growth
last year we introduced our atm services into canada
that two-segment definition is really too simplistic for how our business actually creates value for our customers and shareholders specifically on the payments side
and then at that point we'll assess the market to see whether it makes sense to sell one or both of them
if you look through these two major items our earnings and net operating income are basically flat with last year's june quarter
in conclusion we still have some backfilling to do at some of our warehouse locations as a result of the inordinate amount of tenants that have vacated over the last eight months but are making positive inroads towards higher occupancies prior to year-end
contained in the press release that we issued yesterday afternoon as well as in our filings with the sec in addition some comparisons will refer to non-gaap measures
our earnings release and sec filings contain additional information about these non-gaap measures why we use them and why we believe they're helpful to investors and contain reconciliations to the gaap data
today's call will provide an update on our overall core performance for the second quarter of our fiscal twenty seventeen and
will be a function of eliminating the twenty seventeen expenses to execute the program plus capturing incremental benefits as we achieve the full run rate of the expected savings
we're also slightly trimming our outlook for sales to our process industry end markets to reflect weaker oem order trends
our outlook for the rest of the year we'll cover some specifics on our two platforms followed by selected highlights from our financial statements our liquidity and our cash flow afterwards we'll open up the call for your questions
as well as for some of the institutional verticals within nonrisk construction to reflect some of the uneven nature of how we think the six months plays out
we posted our first quarter slides on the ir home page of our website at heidrickcom and we encourage you to print them for additional context but we won't be referring to specific page numbers during our opening comments
since the beginning of the year we've conducted five intensive training sessions on our heidrick consulting offerings for our search consultants we have three more coming up over the next month
in these sessions consultants from both lines of business work together to identify promising opportunities to expand the breadth of our engagements with clients who only know us for one type of service
so we think we may see some homes closing at a slower average sales price and a customer selecting a fourteen hundred or fifteen hundred square foot instead of a sixteen hundred to eighteen hundred square feet as one of the offsets to rates increasing
we appreciate your continued interest in lgi homes during today's call i will summarize the highlights from the fourth quarter and the full year after -- then charles will follow up to discuss our financial results in more detail
our primary objective when we went public in twenty thirteen was to access the capital markets to fuel our growth by replicating our business model across the country
and therefore the convertible notes were determined to be dilutive this resulted in an approximate one point three million share increase to the weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted eps calculation for the quarter
in summary we are very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and the full year of twenty sixteen we are poised to take advantage of continued growth opportunities in new and existing markets and believe we are well positioned
the first of our five strategies is what we call integrated and open solutions in the cloud
they're becoming unique in the space in k-twelve where our historic competitors
please refer to our most recent form ten-k and sec filings for more information on those risks we believe that a combination of both gaap and non-gaap measures are more representative of how we internally measure our business
the hit we took in q one comparatively to the prior year really equated to
the growth in subscription revenue is a result of our strong and balanced performance across the cloud portfolio migration of our midmarket customers to nxt and
just what we know today that it would be at least as high as what we have in 'sixteen because the continued investment in innovation and the positive improvements in quality that i think we'll continue to see some benefits of next year
our infrastructure and preparing for the move to the cloud on the midmarket we spent quite a bit more in the rdo area and infrastructure and if you aggregate our depreciation and amortization of the software
are you seeing some of those potential enterprise crm customers look at nxt instead
today we will review our q one financial and operational results provide commentary on our performance in the context of our five-point growth strategy
please note that non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from
i'm pleased to say that our first quarter financial performance was a solid start to the year and positions us well to achieve our full year two thousand and sixteen guidance
yes ben so that would be i think two places we still have license largely will be crm-driven we do still sell a handful of new modules or user licenses back to the existing base
i want to pause here and acknowledge what a strong partner herb has been for me and the company in working through this plan herb brings excellent insight and judgment to the cfo role having led one of our fastest-growing offices
in summary as we celebrate our twentieth anniversary we are reigniting our fundamental vision as a company helping the world work differently
the actual numbers are misleading as a result of easter falling in the first five weeks last year but not this year
historic foundation of our GP has been a lot of finance and accounting professionals who are very comfortable calling in those functional areas in a client our business development folks
this financial performance reflects what we have experienced since the start of fiscal two thousand seventeen we have seen limited growth while making investments in our service capabilities for our clients
the sales transformation effort is a multi-step process that we believe will take approximately twelve to eighteen months to complete fully we are building a rigorous sales culture
during this call we will be commenting on our results for the third quarter of fiscal twenty seventeen by now you should have a copy of today's press release if you need a copy and are unable to access the copy on our website
next i will outline the strategic initiative we have launched to improve our profitability and revenue generation i will close by reflecting on our gp's vision and the relevance of our business model in today's economy
which has been a strong performing market for rgp this is a new function in the executive team and one which will help us move from a primarily geographically-focused client service delivery model
representing an effective tax rate of almost forty nine percent our gaap tax rate for each of the upcoming quarters is difficult to predict and could be volatile as the rate will be dependent on several factors including the operating results of our us and foreign locations
i want to begin by noting that our twentieth anniversary as a company happens this month
during the quarter we were also pleased to have expanded orkin's presence internationally by adding six franchises in central america south america
and mosquito and bed bug services in each of the five states in which they operate
when our family first moved to atlanta four years ago it was northwest that knocked on our door and provided excellent pest control and termite services
there will be a replay of the call which will begin one hour after the call and run for one week
and believe they'll be an exceptional addition to rollins founded by the phillips family in nineteen fifty one and headquartered on the outskirts of atlanta
a little over four percent we believe this is in part the result of the improved efficiency from our enhanced routing and scheduling through the virtual route management system
the decrease in the percent of revenue is due to lower administrative salaries as a percent of revenues which continues to see incremental gains from the boss project
we talked in previous quarters about being able to use the technology of boss on things like termite billing
this is an important strategic initiative within marlin two point oh so i'm very pleased to have somebody of dave's caliber in this role
and a recent federal reserve study found that two of the three top issues concerning small businesses were the lack of credit availability and uneven cash flow
and third marlin has been operating for almost two decades with an evolving set of business processes that need to be evaluated and renewed in order to improve the company's operating efficiency
in closing we at marlin are looking forward to achieving the objectives that we have laid out for you on the past two earnings calls
and finally despite transformation expenses incurred during the third quarter that caused the slight decline in roe
so i think we put on something like three hundred loans in the third quarter
i'll begin my remarks today with an overview of the key highlights from this past quarter including an update on our marlin two point oh initiative that i outlined on our call last quarter which is aimed to taking marlin to its next level of growth and profitability
given this overarching goal the company adopted new mission and vision statements during the third quarter two point oh's mission which is a statement of our purpose is to help small businesses achieve their american dream
our new franchise platform also has the potential to become an independent business within two point oh as we work to expand its products beyond just equipment finance
before wrapping up my remarks i'd like to share with you the three strategic objectives that we have established for the next several years as extensions of the new marlin two point oh paradigm
expenses relating to nonrecurring and strategic initiatives tempered eps slightly in the third quarter
the full quarter impact of the new ceo as well as prospective changes to where the company reports expenses relating to its insurance program
we expect full year roe to improve as the business better leverages its fixed costs
business over the next three years which i think will either happen through just natural organic extensions in the existing businesses or
through the combination of these activities we expect to improve marlin's operating efficiency ratio in the coming years to approximately forty five percent and finally our third objective is to use capital more productively
with higher average transaction sizes and a decline in late fees the company experienced a slight increase of seven basis points in cost of funds
and that growth is going to come from slower growth within our traditional core channels probably five percent growth and substantial growth within the new channels and the expansion channels that jeff mentioned
due to a variety of factors we refer you to marlin's recent filings with the sec for more detailed discussions
a transformative process which we are referring to as marlin two point oh through this transformation process we expect to drive sustainable growth
we are currently six weeks into this effort and while it is still early days in what will ultimately be a six- to nine-month project i am very encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of the potential gains in throughput while maintaining current headcount levels
we already have installed capacity above three million tons of heavy plates this is a market that
you pose two questions the one would be working capital and what would be the level of working capital
when you decide that this volume goes into the market six months afterwards because you have to reconnect the plant you have to hire new people
during the second half was not considered in this srep decision so we could expect this to continue
some of these bids will be -- can happen during the current year but they can happen next year or even in two years from now
before almost twenty thirty so that's why it's so important for us to have really a good footprint
we will continue to integrate business acquisitions made in the past two years in order to capture cross-selling opportunities across our network
slide nine shows our results compared with the outlook we provided on our second quarter call in july
the general economics of the agreement provide for national mi to retain a margin of up to eighty percent of the ceded premium
in summary we had another excellent quarter highlighted by our first quarterly profit and are tracking to a highly profitable second half of two thousand and sixteen with that
second only to the day we wrote our first mortgage insurance policy just three years ago
the underwriting environment continues to be very high quality more than half of the business we are writing is at fico scores of seven six oh plus
although deeper mi coverage would help to expand the market national mi does not need a larger market to fulfill our primary financial objectives
let me now turn it back over to brad for his closing remarks thank you glenn this has been an exciting time at national mi
we are also grateful to our customers for believing in national mi and our shareholders and business partners for supporting us since our founding
before the impact of reinsurance we expect premium yield on our primary book to continue to migrate upward to around fifty bps over the next several quarters
and four of the participants are new entrants to our sector they see national mi as an attractive partner for their first domestic mi treaty and we expect they will be receptive to future transactions with us
in addition to our strong q two financial results and establishing a reinsurance agreement
should we expect for the full year that you can keep growing double digits obviously understanding you're going to have one less week next year than you did this year
and eight point nine million daily active users added in the fourth quarter the highest number of quarterly net adds since the third quarter of twenty sixteen all this growth came at a lower cost than the previous quarter
the retention rate of new android users increased by nearly twenty percent when compared to last year meaning that the people who try snapchat on android are much more likely to stick around and become daily active users
we entered twenty eighteen energized by the opportunities in front of us and excited to deliver against our plan for user growth augmented reality and content i'll now hand over the call to imran for a discussion of our business results
promoted story allows brands to take advantage of the familiar stories format that we invented four years ago
in q four we made a lot of good progress with snap pixel we focused on scaling its usage as well as building out its capabilities
so let me comment on the first question so we did comment on the underlying drivers for the spike-up that we did see in the fourth quarter and we did share how we're thinking internally about the q one dynamics
today's call is to provide you with information regarding our fourth quarter and full year two thousand seventeen performance in addition to our financial outlook
this additional detail may be onetime in nature and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics please refer to our filings with the sec to understand how we calculate our metrics with that i'd like to turn the call over to evan
as evan mentioned we launched lens studio less than two months ago to make it easier for our community and our advertisers to create lenses
in just two months since its launch some of the most visited websites have installed the pixel across thousands of domains
we drove a sixteen percentage point lift in action intent to shop at target for the holidays as measured by nielsen
many of the auction dynamics were consistent with prior quarters although ad volumes were much higher in q four it was very encouraging to see some substantial daily sales volumes flowing through the auction during the quarter
with our plans for user growth augmented reality and content in twenty eighteen i've never been more excited about the future of our business we're going to keep up the hard work and stay focused on the big opportunities ahead
a set of desktop creative tools that make it easy for anyone to create their own augmented reality experiences and distribute them using snapchat in just six weeks from launch over thirty thousand lenses were created by our community and viewed over one billion times
as expected it will take time for our community to get used to the changes but overall we are pleased with the initial results and we'll be making the redesign available to our entire community in q one there is a lot of work ahead as we optimize the updated application
compared to the old design core metrics around content consumption and time spent in the redesigned application are disproportionately higher for users over the age of thirty five which bodes well for increasing engagement among older users as we continue to grow our business
more importantly our community is embracing our new format on average users that chose to watch promoted stories viewed them for over ten seconds
we drove fifteen times more app installs in december compared to april while continuing to drive increased return on investment
in three months we more than tripled the number of advertisers spending in our auction
we executed well on our twenty seventeen plan to improve quality performance and automation which removed friction from our advertising business and improved our application for the snapchat community
and out of all our international offices this region was our top contributor to overall revenue growth in q four still we have a lot of opportunity to make it even easier for advertisers
in twenty eighteen there is much to do and we are focused to deliver on our key priorities i want to share some financial thoughts with you for the early part of the year
and obviously we're taking the capital out of the business as we do it so that's really two wins that we've been executing on on the infrastructure side
with two major pork plants coming online at the same time we're going to have a lot more hogs if you look at
because of the increase of profit level for us business the operating profit contribution is already more than half
is about structural changes leading to such fluctuations q three according to the trend
have talked about five to six major points in relation to our future development and these are his conclusions after looking into the chinese market
one of our fundamental strengths as the wh group has to be the arbitrage of meat around the world we have to find the best market for that
it is possible to run the fcc unit in a modified mode while the other refinery units are repaired
we expect art revenue to be up double digits this year with improved product margins reflecting the strong demand for our hydroprocessing technologies
we lapped the effect of these transactions by the end of q two second
this mix effects were mostly driven by the rebalancing of our fcc sales in the wake of the continuing customer outage and the effect of the polyolefin catalyst acquisition
somewhere in the middle of q four or right at the end of q three roger we got a couple of different scenarios in our outlook so the timing is kind of hard to pin down but we know by the end of year it'll be exhausted
we expect to introduce our second-generation mto catalyst before the end of this year
this morning's announcement is a great example this will be the largest single train pp unit in the world
we are working closely with several customers on new catalysts for these units and expect good growth over the next two to three years as these plants reach full utilization
that demand is up significantly this year and we expect it to continue to grow over the next two or three years
i don't mind saying we've been a little surprised too at how fast licensing has come back six or nine months ago we were prepared for a couple of years of
please see our recent sec filings for more details on the risks that could impact grace's future operating results and financial condition
some of these units will be large and are being built to produce petrochemical feedstocks similar to the units we began supplying in q two we have a solid position in this high-value product segment
and ebit and ebitda to be in the lower half of their respective ranges
as you look out three-plus years do you see meaningful opportunity for consolidation in the industry or rather is it the case that
and can you quantify the impact of the turnaround in terms of ebit we spent not all of this is running through q two earnings but we spent
we will discuss certain non-gaap financial measures which are described in more detail in this morning's earnings release and on our website at grace dot com reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures
although the customer outage has affected our sales and margins this year our strategy is unchanged we are focused on delivering value to our customers in the most demanding fcc applications
more sophisticated random and impact copolymers our licensing pipeline is healthy and growing with more than ten opportunities expected to reach decision points in the next six to nine months
while the recent announcements involving zte and huawei present new uncertainties we currently expect limited effect on short-term business in china i'll explain that in further detail later in the call
and then resume more normalized growth through coming quarters in twenty eighteen a couple of other things i'd like to note before moving on to data centers
the transaction which we expect will close during our fiscal q three includes a license fee as well as the sale of related inventory and manufacturing equipment at net book value
to begin contributing to revenue growth in calendar twenty eighteen and for many years to come
i think our degree of exposure is materially different than it used to be but let me provide some color on the huawei situation i would caution people not to lead to the same denial of export that zte got
was direct cost related to the manufacturing and production side so that goes through cogs more so there's a couple of
looking at some of the moving pieces as i reported last november we saw an abrupt and significant pickup in orders in pon demand for which had flatlined in the previous six months
last quarter we received volume production orders for three gan programs that i had referred to in previous calls
this is the strongest bidding activity that i've seen in my five years at macom on top of this groundswell of activity
at a higher level the future looks very bright for macom the industry is entering the next phase of infrastructure spending globally
we've passed all those gates now we have the production on those first three programs so that's vitally important because performing operationally was the last thing that we had to do
so from the numbers we've seen this year they're getting back to eighty percent of the unit volume on the client side of the previous peak
which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties because actual results may differ materially from those discussed today macom claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements
we spent the early part of the march quarter reloading our production pipeline and had a partial quarter of shipments in q two current forecasts from our customers and recent tenders from carriers
in summary we expect our various optical gan and fem products
with the recent award of five g metro and provincial deployments in nokia shanghai bell and others the last remaining pocket of the downturn caused by the china government transition looks to soon be behind us
we're falling back on a chipset business it actually allows with our supply chain partners a better cost structure to our tosa customers
so i would fully expect that huawei would be complying with everything necessary to clean their name and if there was a bad actor they would be taking action where it seems that zte did not
we will now sell chipsets and enable low-cost manufacturing partners for subassemblies this action is expected to result in better overall cost structures for our tosa customers
in total we expect sales in the data centers to grow progressively through each quarter in twenty eighteen as we scale analog and laser capacity and ramp our l-pic solutions
while the latest developments with zte and huawei create new uncertainties it's important to note that macom supplies technology and products that are not readily replicated by anyone anywhere including china
either orders or three customers that you have that have given you production-type orders would you clarify what you mean by that
in addition with a significant real estate in our portfolio we have alternative capital sources from which to pull to continue our prudent growth strategy in twenty sixteen without accessing the equity markets
if you turn to the next slide you will see how we have performed over the past two years through very different crude price environments
we also experienced a lot of site change in the period as we completely dealerized the one stop locations while adding the ssg sites late in the quarter
on slide nine we have detailed a chart to compare the performance of this quarter to the same period last year as noted previously we are experiencing a significant contribution from our recent acquisitions
the typical seasonal trend is for the third quarter volume to decline three percent to five percent from the second quarter
in the third quarter last year we completed the acquisition of northern illinois steel supply and all metal services followed by the fourth quarter two thousand and fourteen acquisition of fox metals and alloys
we are cautious in regard to both business activity levels and metal pricing in the fourth quarter of two thousand fifteen these factors combined with two less shipping days in the fourth quarter
rough feel for twenty sixteen capex at this point and any commentary you can make on working capital as well
at seven percent flat-rolled pricing has been under pressure for over a year now with
our board amended our share repurchase plan and increased the authorized number of shares available to be repurchased by seven point five million
in the first quarter of twenty fifteen sales to the aerospace market have increased as a percentage of our total sales
given strong underlying demand pricing for aerospace aluminum plate has increased with two price increases announced this year
because metal prices decline more than we had anticipated in the two thousand fifteen third quarter as compared to the two thousand fifteen second quarter we increased our estimate of our annual lifo inventory valuation adjustment
now representing nearly ten percent in the third quarter of two thousand and fifteen we believe reliance remains very well-positioned to gain market share in this area on a global basis
this adjustment reflects lifo accounting working in the manner intended reducing fifo cost of sales in a declining price environment to value inventory at current replacement cost
these charges are presented in our table of non-gaap net income and earnings per share amounts in our press release issued earlier today
calculated on our september thirty inventory levels and year-to-date shipment levels
our release and today's commentary include non-gaap financial measures which exclude the impact of restructuring acquisition and divestiture expenses and charges in current year results
i'm proud of the company we have built over our first two years and believe we have one of the safest and most engaged workforce in the industry that drives a high level of execution and performance
this was partially offset by acquisitions and strong organic growth in americas emeia and the asia pacific mechanical and electronic hardware business
we look forward to twenty sixteen as an opportunity to build on our prior results
and we'll continue to get good leverage on the incremental volume so i would anticipate the margin improvement to accelerate a little bit in twenty sixteen basis of the incremental volume forecasted
supported by our twenty fifteen performance we believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market with higher returns on invested capital
the growth of both revenue margin will make an investments in our business and demonstrates the disciplined approach we set out two years ago
continued really excellent execution relative to our march towards the ten percent target i'd say we ended the year pretty much in line
was approximately one percent this is a significant accomplishment and we feel we are well positioned for continued
incremental investments which are forecasted to be lower in twenty fifteen will be focused on new products and channel development to meet
our investments in new products will provide growth not just for twenty sixteen but for sustained growth in the future
both simonsvoss and axa performed well in the quarter and are delivering on the expected results
our own data from the newton study showed that those patients that receive the current standard of care
and intensity of medical care required and the procedures needed for these patients during those seventeen days in the intensive care unit and the twenty five days that are required in the hospital
based on our current plans we expect our cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the full data read out from our newton-two study
like returning patients back to work or the reduction of icu and hospital length of stay that we've already seen in the newton study
should we expect those two variables to continue to weigh on your profitability in the fourth quarter and early next year
at eleven percent for the year but we're going to go through in more detail of what we did specifically in the second semester to really accelerate our investments towards our strategy so for the year we finished
we had to have it so we're rolling that out in q one and announcing that here
a product a oh point one product release where we're just addressing some issues this is all innovation that was necessary for us to have a platform
being able to keep this momentum that we build along the h two and during this first semester to have a very successful first
if our signature metric is growing then the health of our new sales is growing and continuing so as we go through this transformation we may have positive or negative license throughout the years but my acv is growing
it's all either being released in q one or putting in public data so we could go-to-market at the end of this quarter with a true platform
before going exactly on how we invested i want to use three key successes of the year three key successes that demonstrate the value of the amplify platform and our strategy the first one a large bank in brazil
creating a new business and wanted to launch a full brand and a full business in less than four months
and we plan to do so in twenty nineteen additionally twenty nineteen is still a year of some investments we have to do so i still have to do some work on the
and all of this to become a leader in the hybrid integration platform market by twenty twenty so with all of this strategy and if we could become the leader in twenty twenty that really gives me
subscription specific but other elements like mft they may want to continue to run it in their server room for their own reasons and buy a license for budgeting or other reasons
the last mile i call it to go from your hub out to a salesforce i'm not going to build a thousand of those or invest it somebody else does it better i'd like to work with someone else to provide that
the analysts and the market is telling us that's where it's going but from a business model and from a financial model if you look back over the last ten years we've been relatively flat on average
so you could list them and they are available to see in the catalog and this is what the customer would be running if they bought the amplify
an exciting company that we could use as a platform for the next ten to fifteen years of axway and it sets us
and we're taking our new subscription acv or annual contract value
that is the constant challenge that we're taking on and going to continue in that investment in twenty nineteen but we were able to do a lot of it in the second half of the year
as i talked about in july i took over as CEO in april until in july we had done a lot of work to
are now available in my catalog so when i was talking about the catalog and the power of the catalog so we're putting our mft or b two b flows that's where we meet our customers that's what they're looking to us security
and if we were to do the math of this expense by the multiple of ebitda we would see that there is a discount as well
we have already seen a good dilution of fixed cost so in payroll and services this was very favorable in these two quarters already sequentially and what we had in terms of
in the fourth quarter of 'eighteen and this initiative of liability management continues underway
from the ebitda that you generate that is question number one question number two can you comment on the progress that you're making with pricing both in domestic coated board
we'll be talking about what we are seeing in the mid and the last two years and very much in the last year and we still see there
and moving the balance that was in other fi services to the fraud security risk management and operational services category
and forms and accessories expected to represent approximately twenty percent of revenue
we understand it is important for us to maintain low decline rates but given the size of the FS checks business now
we anticipate that marketing solutions and other services revenue which is primarily fraud and securities offers for this segment to be about ten percent of direct checks revenue
but as this evolves as i mentioned and you picked up and remembered well from the january six call is
we are also providing a directional annual ebitda margin profile in total and for each of the five mos categories
that our mos ebitda margins are also now approaching our overall company average
so i do expect that i will complete the search and hopefully be able to announce a new cfo by the next earnings call
we believe there is an opportunity to bring the data and information that we have on those four point four million small businesses
higher earnings and lower interest payments were partially offset by higher income tax and contract acquisition payments as well as an incentive payment in twenty fifteen from a previous acquisition
if achieved this performance would translate to a total revenue mix of thirty eight percent of revenue
operating margins -- or ebitda margins but we are going to continue to work each of these categories as we continue to transform the company
we completed the acquisition of fmcg which will further enhance our financial services marketing solutions and other services product set
as we exit two thousand sixteen on the heels of a strong quarterly performance and a continued sluggish economy we have made tremendous progress in transforming deluxe
going to slide seven with record production and a strong cost performance we succeeded in generating solid financial results for the year
the majority of which took place on the smc this strong mineral resource space lends itself to potential reserve growth conversion in the future
this afternoon we're always happy when we can all be in the same place and have an opportunity to talk to the market and we're even happier when we can put out some of the results that we've done over the last twenty four hours so
for fosterville beginning in two thousand and eighteen looking at other expenses the growth in the size of our business portfolio was a primary factor in leading to an increase in corporate general and administrative expenses
in two thousand sixteen you can expect more of the same from us as we invest in our brands and our infrastructure and our people we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent profitable and sustainable growth
that in two thousand and seventeen we should have some material impact from that work and even in the short term on some of the rapid replenishment as we're piloting some of those things we should have some early read on that too so
for total core revenue growth of eighteen basis points on assets when you include harbor and sunshine and steve can give you some more color
looking forward into twenty nineteen we continue to expect cost saves from charter to be fully realized in the second quarter after the conversion of the core systems
building the company to grow everything good in the company ten percent a year through a cycle
and also increased seven basis points from the third quarter in two thousand seventeen this upward trend has continued even with the effects of our purchase of lower core nim banks that we purchased this year
and branch consolidations and over the last two years we've consolidated a total of forty five branches and increased our average deposits per branch along the way so we're encouraged by the positive revenue trends in the last year
please refer to the gaap versus non-gaap reconciliations in our presentation which contain the reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures
expense that we need to keep in mind with ais or are we all done with that next quarter
and that they don't start moving more aggressively on price the likely timing for that would be beginning of calendar twenty nineteen but of course depending upon how hot things get we could always go sooner
i spent some time in iowa two weeks ago with the deco team and came away very excited about our continued prospects for growth
and to achieve a return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital in the third full year and we expect ais to meet both of those financial hurdles
and when you combine the two solutions together and also offer payments which we first talked to you about
with the introduction of gst and with the earlier vat regime some of the arbitrage is gone that we believe it becomes a very very interesting opportunity for us to focus upon
so what you could do in fifty years in the past in a traditional industry that in a technology industry you can do it much faster and we have been very successful in terms of compressing time
i would also like to remind everyone that all figures are being quoted in us dollars unless otherwise stated
in twenty nineteen we're relatively confident that we'll be able to get back to our targets
we expect thp's results to remain below our target for the next couple of quarters as we continue to implement budget updates on our remaining investments although we believe the results are stabilizing as you can see by the bar graph on the slide
using these internally generated cash flows we believe we are well positioned to execute on our current growth initiatives including the tah joint venture that we recently announced
for more information please refer to our most recent management discussion and analysis and annual information form which are available on sedar and our company website
we did receive a favorable response from the regulators and there is an opportunity for nuvo to submit a revised registration dossier containing our existing clinical data to select eu member states
management's prepared remarks will track the presentation please turn to slide four to follow along please note that any references to figures in this presentation are qualified in their entirety by the endnotes at the back of the presentation
in our non-qm loan strategy we reached critical mass for a second securitization which i'm happy to announce we actually just priced earlier this morning
we would need to make certain portfolio adjustments to comply with the reit rules as a result of these adjustments we would expect the growth rate of our net investment income to slow temporarily
we own a forty five percent stake and where we work closely with management to increase franchise value lendsure is a maturing company with a broad geographic footprint
we are now in a position to say that EFC expects to convert to a real estate investment trust or reit during the first half of two thousand and nineteen barring an unforeseen impediments in connection with such a conversion
you can track changes in portfolio size and composition on slide eight we continued to be less focused on the more commoditized credit sectors
we would expect to take several steps to help qualify as a reit including selling certain non-real estate related assets and moving other non-real estate related assets into taxable reit subsidiaries
that said we still expect that the credit strategy will continue to be by far the main driver of efc's earnings
where thanks to our proprietary sourcing and origination channels we have assembled a portfolio of assets with a blended unlevered market yield of eight point eight percent as we did in the prior quarter
several strategies that generated significant gains last quarter had smaller gains or modest losses in q three and we also had net losses on our credit hedges this quarter as opposed to net gains last quarter
please turn to slide seven for details on the attribution of earnings between our credit and agency strategies
as our portfolio size increased we also added some credit hedges as you can see on slide sixteen jr and larry mentioned that our adjusted net income effectively covered our dividend for the quarter
a reit conversion would also be facilitated by exchanging a portion of our public senior unsecured notes for private notes issued by one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries
as to the assets that efc would sell in preparation for a conversion we expect that they will predominantly consist of lower yielding non-core assets we would expect to sell certain
so that also was a huge factor we did look at a c corp because we knew that a c corp would give us the most flexibility frankly of any structure even more
finally i will provide some closing remarks including more detail on our plans which we announced last night on our earnings release to convert to a reit in the first half of twenty nineteen then we'll open the floor to questions
we expect to finalize our plans over the remainder of twenty eighteen as always investor feedback on these issues is welcome
that the bank was able to design and offer suitable and attractive financial services to mts current customers
it is important to note that quite apart from the number of retail stores in the russian market we continue to see improving trends in the overall amount of sim card sales
today my mts is not just an instrument for the customers to cover basic operations like checking their balance or topping up mobile accounts it is a comprehensive offering
and the continued reduction in churn we estimate that in two thousand and eighteen the number of gross additions to the market
at argo nearly two decades ago we identified technology as a transformative and potentially disruptive force
in our international segment the second quarter revenue numbers are somewhat distorted by the decision we made at the end of twenty seventeen to increase the amount of third-party capital participation primarily related to the reinsurance lines of business
that probably equates to five or six points on the combined ratio this year as compared to eight or ten a year ago
is the -- would you say the legal environment is more challenging today than maybe two three years ago
if the same set of events happened again this year another way to think about it other than just absolute dollars is loss ratio points for the year and we're talking about five or six points
were solid performance from our alternatives the hedge fund investments as well as pe structured funds and our internal special situations portfolio
i don't expect it to be linear i think it'll be lumpy because three months is too short a period of time but i think that the trend is directionally correct over the next four or five quarters
and this -- knowing that the vehicles -- that we are currently remarketing that there are also still a large number of euro-five vehicles included
actual results may be different factors that may cause actual results to differ include those identified in our annual report on form ten-k and our earnings press release
credit quality remains solid with lower nonperformers and very modest losses in the third quarter for the first nine months we were actually in a net recovery position
we still expect the full year margin to be in the low threeforties range which is consistent with our original guidance
we brought on a capital planning manager to build out our dfast capabilities
build out the dfast model without acquiring any sort of expensive softwares or without having significant consulting expense
still full year organic growth is expected to be within the three percent to five percent range originally established for the year and most likely at the upper end of that range
and we don't see us getting real sales from that effort until two thousand and seventeen and talking about the specifics of what those products are
as noted in the form ten-k we have taken a number of steps to alleviate our liquidity situation
which began in the first quarter of two thousand and fifteen but these reductions could not offset the impact of our reduced sales levels
when he refers to 'seventeen he's referring to the recapture of that lost business in the industry so that's what we think do we know we don't know but we think that in 'seventeen we don't see it happening in the next twelve months
and i'm thinking that by two thousand and seventeen that will be cleared up and they will be trying to compete with their competitors
because i would hate to -- i personally wouldn't do if i was on the board of your company do a financial transaction knowing that two thousand seventeen could be really big
potential contracts and why i think 'seventeen could be a lift and the range and all that stuff because if you guys have internal models showing that which i'm sure you do then you're transacting on data
our final goal is superior portfolio management in this context we further strengthened our capital allocation process and we continue to maintain a fifteen percent hurdle rate for new investments
please review the cautionary statements included in our press release and presentation as well as the risk factors described in our most recent form forty-f and the annual information form i will now turn the call over to michael
our mining shaft has been designed to go ultimately to a thousand meters in this first stage for our current ten-year reserve plus
overs and unders one thousand eight hundred tonnes a day is the design we feel pretty comfortable with that we would have to do some other things to really think about trying to increase that underground
a kind of a slow ramp up to that fifteen hundred tonnes a day as we get into those stopes we kind of want to open up
right away in the pulp agglomeration it has about an eight-hour retention time and we get those kind of extraction rates
is sufficient for us to meet our return hurdles while providing a competitive edge for tcap from a product mix standpoint
the primary variables affecting our nav this quarter were the positive effects of our march equity offering
and indeed on this point it is important for all you to know that my primary focus as chairman and ceo is for triangle capital to continue to grow
and i think there was a period of time in the market that if we had to look back to in two thousand and twelve the end of 'twelve second half of 'twelve and
just wondering to what extent this theme will play out in two thousand seventeen and in particular was there any acceleration of
including those disclosed under the sections titled risk factors and forward-looking statements in our annual report on form ten-k
all while not losing a single lender and gaining increased commitments from eleven of our thirteen lenders
as we translate our recent investing experience into a view for the balance of twenty seventeen we are encouraged by our ability to screen for
the investments in capital contractors garden fresh and gerli were already valued at zero as of december thirty one of last year and therefore the realized losses did not affect our net asset value during the quarter
and to participate richly as the bdc industry continues to evolve and develop into a major component of our country's capital market system
john my personal opinion is i think we've seen a little bit of a bottoming out on pricing i would think going forward you should see plus or minus ten percent for newly originated transactions for us
the great data there of the last trailing twelve months on a quarterly basis i think illustrates that we're now running at
the acceleration of origination can occur versus what would be some directly originated ones that take three to four months so you could see
as we move through the balance of twenty seventeen we are extremely pleased to have such a sound financial foundation
and there was no question that as the four g technology is maturing and we are getting ready for five G there is a bit of a pause in terms of
and then my second question is on the working capital was there an underlying improvement in each of the divisions or was the improvement mainly driven by mix and i wondered if you could give the outlook for working capital for 'seventeen okay
single account they run but they are also responsible for liaising with their colleagues inside of intertek to basically make sure they can get the atic solution they need for their customers inside the group portfolio
it -- looks like you've just changed the description from robust to good in terms of the outlook it feels like global gdp growth is still looking pretty robust so can you just talk about the change there
as a CEO what you need to do is be very clear about the directions we're going be very clear about how you measure performance and ask the right questions
and the good news is that the first promotion that was executed at these lower price points has had a nice positive impact on the business so as we look at the balance of two thousand and nineteen i think we've got a better
we expect strong store additions for the full year including a total of twenty seven to thirty two newly constructed company stores we are raising our franchise store growth expectations based on the strong start to the year
the DIY consumer has to visit the store to recycle the oil they have to return the oil back to the store so there's already a store
a sign of weakness in q one so i do think that's partly driven by the slowdown in china so we'll be keeping a close eye on that
my expectation with some innovation that you have coming online would be that from that kind of one percent base growth level that we could see that
that beyond q four you should start to see inflation gradually start to moderate the other thing that we're seeing is -- now that was commodities if you'll look at freight
retail segment growth can at least pick up from kind of a one percent run rate improvement level
gross profit for the quarter was also weighed down by increased depreciation expense and two unusual nonrecurring charges
note the lower tax rate of twenty seven point four in the current year reflects the favorable impact of the recent tax legislation
while these items may recur in q four as well due to their nature it is not possible to estimate their exact impacts
you heard in the comments earlier i think what we described is that our aggregate commodity inflation net of sourcing activities was about one percent of our consolidated
we aggressively marketed to mobile e-mails and social to our engaged digital community of over seven million customers
and two are locations that choose to go with a virtual bookstore instead of a physical store
our two companies will remain intently focused on being a true strategic partner to the colleges and universities we serve
highlighted about ten digital courses at select universities is there any update on how that's going what type of traction you're seeing and kind of what the feedback from some of the universities such as penn state might be
turning to slide five let me now take a few minutes to talk a little bit more about mbs as one of the largest used book wholesalers and largest
after factoring in the first three weeks of february that contributed to the spring rush
we continue to be awarded new contracts which will result in opening two additional stores expected to open before the end of the fiscal year
the transaction was unanimously approved by the full board and closed yesterday on february twenty seven along with the entire board and management team we are extremely pleased to have mbs and its people
also this gives us a better -- we now have a better ability to manage our inventories as one virtual -- eventually one virtual inventory for all of our stores and mbs wholesale
i spent the last eight weeks traveling to several of our offices around the globe meeting with employees and learning the details of the business and i'm pleased to work report that i've discovered a number of very encouraging facts
with many installations that we anticipate will continue to benefit us in twenty sixteen our offshore production fluids business also had a strong year
a strong us dollar particularly against a weakening chinese yuan and british pound will continue to impact our reported results for most of the year but we are hopeful that this devaluation has begun to stabilize
this is what we did in the fourth quarter and are continuing to do so in two thousand and sixteen for me back to basics means a focus on our customers and on organic growth establishing our team and core processes
and by proactive cost actions taken by macdermid as we look into twenty sixteen we expect to see another strong year in industrial and automotive
we have been getting a lot of questions from investors on both our capital structure and covenants the next two slides address these subjects
we believe our acquisitions of alent and the om group businesses create a complementary and diversified solutions provider with a broad reach across the electronics and automotive markets
credit management will remain a key priority in twenty sixteen especially amidst the weakened economic environment in latin america
foreign exchange remains front of mind and on page thirteen we pulled together some numbers to help you understand our current pro forma fx exposures
on page five we have laid out some of my initial observations priorities and outlook for the
the newly acquired alent and om group assets experienced modest headwinds particularly from the electronics end markets but performed in line with our expectations
we are expecting growth in our asia business as we annualize the benefit of a number of new installations in twenty fifteen and increase our position in certain mobile phone supply chains
as we look to twenty sixteen we are seeing a macro ag environment that feels similar to what we saw in twenty fifteen fx will continue to be a headwind in the first half of the year
will be the beginning of a positive trend in the back half of twenty sixteen and into twenty seventeen we will provide some more color around what to expect for q one near the end of the call
how those exposures impacted our twenty fifteen results and what sort of actions we are taking to help mitigate these risks today and in the future
this was slightly better than we had expected as attrition from the client that we discussed last quarter has not started as expected note we still expect rcm revenues to slow in the back half of the fiscal year
jocelyn has been a great asset to this organization and a great team member to that end jocelyn has decided to move out of the gc role and seek that next chapter
one of the things that we said was we're about six months behind where we wanted to be in launching the programs that we really feel will enable this bookings growth to show up
our company remarks on today's call include both our earnings results and guidance which contains certain non-gaap financial measures
our acquisition of eagledream is another step in the right direction and our laser focus on client satisfaction over the last two years has positively impacted our maintenance attrition which now has come down to just over six percent on a trailing twelve-month basis
what nextgen offers our clients today compared to two years ago is worlds apart
with that in mind we're about to kick off a twenty-city road show to both existing and potential new clients so that our leadership team can meet with senior executives including myself
my cto will probably reach out to me and give me an even better number after this but we're moving very quickly with it and we feel very good about that now as we move forward the question is not
but the other is analytics truly informing practice and i think that's what you'll see as we move over the next six twelve eighteen months is the really coming together of use cases that span the entire solution platform
it's about seventy it's about seventy it's relatively stable at this point in time but as we've moved through the past year we have had some turnover that was kind of expected as we really transition from selling products to solutions
we also wanted to bring your attention that as noted in the ten-q we filed today we have received a civil investigative demand letter from the department of justice
and that's really job one but as we start to bring things like our new acquisition on the analytics space to the table which enables our clients to not just report
somewhere between minus fifty and minus sixty as we sit here today we're at minus five and continuing to trend upwards so
really bring those two things together along with entrada into a really powerful combination that not only identifies problems but truly allows those problems to be addressed
and i think that's the way you should look at it and it's going to take some investment actually for 'eighteen but
hold that as a good proxy for what you could expect for the three divisions as an average organically
in 'eighteen because of that if you look at new acquisition where we have also said that we don't see that will have any material impact on the ebit in 'eighteen so the new acquisition
in revenue at the time and that was basically to take an even stronger position in the floor grinding segment HTC is the market leader in that segment
is about the margin and i previously talked about the ambition to be reaching the ten percent margin
from a revenue point of view it will be noticeable but it will not turn anything upside down in 'eighteen but if you give this two three years it will be quite significant i dare to say
yes from what we can see now with the limited visibility we have we have reason to be optimistic about the markets of twenty eighteen what gives me then the confidence to be
we anticipate a midyear approval which would enable us to begin our eu rolling launch and our pricing and reimbursement efforts in select countries in the eu during the second half of this year
will be lowered to a range of seventeen percent to nineteen percent based on our current business profile
what ability par has to launch its own generic starting the end of twenty twenty five and whether they would need to have their own independent rems program in order to launch that
and since january one how many of them have actually rolled back to being commercial patients
help us understand is that a tool that you can use to help facilitate changes to the drg payment is that something that's in your control at all
we believe these non-gaap financial measures are helpful in our understanding our past financial performance and potential future results
in twenty seventeen defitelio became available in canada and we submitted for marketing approval in brazil our global team continues to identify further geographic regions for expansion
and we will be entitled to receive meaningful royalties on that sales by par over the ag sales period
on combination with some of the targeted therapies for aml that might lead to some of that use could that potentially come this year will it be next year
they are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable reported gaap measures reconciliations of gaap to non-gaap financial measures discussed on this call
in twenty eighteen our global sales force will continue to educate health care providers on the importance of recognizing hypersensitivity reactions
and the positive trend we observed in new patient enrollments during twenty seventeen give us confidence that we will continue to generate positive volume growth
we also granted par a nonexclusive patent license to launch its generic sodium oxybate product as of december thirty one twenty twenty five these entry dates could be accelerated under certain circumstances
in twenty eighteen we plan to invest aggressively in driving strong performance of our key products
the need for a separate rems would have been the exact same answers if you had asked about the previous settlements we reached
part of it is how do you explore new indications we talked about three new indications we're exploring
and we think it's an interesting place to study solriamfetol given some of the things we know about pd patients and we know about the mechanism of action of this drug
and an operational issue with the central pharmacy in the second half of twenty seventeen caused by implementation of a new automated phone system that delayed some prescription fulfillment
i would say it's almost certainly true that we will enter a third therapeutic area will that be in twenty eighteen hard to say
good morning everyone and thanks for joining us this morning we announced strong results for the third quarter of fiscal twenty nineteen primarily reflecting continued robust aerospace industry demand for our flight deck printers and associated supplies
in the quarter we introduced a number of new products and technology enhancements during the major fall trade show season at both the labelexpo americas and pack expo international trade shows both held in chicago this year
before concluding i would like to take this opportunity to publicly welcome jean bua executive vice president and chief financial officer of nasdaq-listed netscout systems
the t two-c was also a big hit particularly among large brand owners who recognize the benefits of our compact efficient professional label press and its high return on investment
in addition this year with the implementation of our renewed erp system which we expect
at appliedmaterials dot com and now i'd like to turn the call over to gary dickerson thanks mike i'm pleased to report that our revenue for the quarter was up nineteen percent compared to the same period last year and the second highest in the company's history
for example we recently announced a collaboration with arm to develop a neuromorphic switch that can enable new approaches to ai computing
i think some of your customers are making some progress on the technology front i think one of your nand customers
and the other thing i would say relative to patterning there are really two major areas of focus one is shrinking features but the other one is placing features in the right position
stepping back and looking at the broader context two thousand and eighteen shows how the industry has fundamentally changed over the past five years
this program is part of darpa's electronics resurgence initiative to develop new computing materials designs and architectures
using advanced packaging techniques all five of these approaches will require major advances in materials engineering and create huge opportunities for applied
as compared to two thousand and twelve and the best indication of applied's resilience is our services business
or flat mostly up in all of the previous six years so if you take an overall look at the company over the last few years one of the big things that we've driven is a much better balance across all device types
i strongly believe that the most exciting days for the industry and applied are ahead of us over the next decade ai and big data will transform almost every sector of the economy
to position the company to play a larger and more valuable role in the ai big data era now dan will give his perspective on our performance and outlook
so i guess here's the comments that i would make on the nand market
we talked about eps in my prepared comments a single quarter is now larger than what this company used to do in a full year
as the industry moves to ninety six layers and above can you give us a little bit of an update
for three d nand the -- and we have some really tremendously enabling capabilities the etch business for us is continuing to grow our conductor
and i've really got two choices that we're thinking about one is we squeeze it in before the end of the year
including those discussed in the risk factors section of dicerna's most current forms filed with the sec while
the strength in our balance sheet provides sufficient capital to support our clinical goals for our ph
we expect to dose the first chronic hbv patients during the second quarter of twenty nineteen the study is designed to evaluate patients in two different groups
we have completed dosing for both healthy volunteers and patients with ph type one and
regarding dcr-hbvs we continue to dose healthy volunteers
as with the alexion collaboration most of this will be recognized as revenue over the next three years
i don't think that we can get any direct read of how not targeting the x gene affects what the data would have been like the
we start dosing in q two and if you just run the clock and allow us to see some of the
and a productive immune response against the virus by the patient or zero conversion and the combination of those two is generally agreed to be a functional cure and is
and solidified two new substantial collaborations based on our galxc platform with eli lilly
we still anticipate submitting regulatory filings in the second quarter of twenty nineteen at which point we will be able to fully discuss the program and strategy
i'd now like to take a few minutes to provide a recap of key two thousand and eighteen events and recent notable achievements
what i can tell you at this point is that similar to our strategy around ph
we're working with alexion's team on the joint discovery and development of galxc rnai molecules directed to two complement pathway targets for the treatment of complement mediated diseases
the majority of the balance of deferred revenue associated with the alexion collaboration will be recognized over the anticipated three-year term of the initial research programs
thank you jack it's -- i think it's fair to say that twenty eighteen was a true breakout year for dicerna and i would like to thank our entire team our partners and our shareholders for contributing to the success we have achieved thus far
we expect the most significant drop in volumes to occur in the fourth quarter of our current fiscal year as brazil shipped heavily in the fourth fiscal quarter of two thousand and sixteen and we do not expect to attain a similar level of shipments there this fiscal year
for next year in terms of plantings supply and demand for the industry will be more balanced oversupply can you give me any -- kind of your thoughts as we think about next year for fiscal 'eighteen it would be
given that we installed roughly the same number of devices in q four as we sold
these foreign exchange benefits were mostly reflected in our q four results but they will have a positive impact on our first half comparisons
to borrow the analogy from another industry we are at the apple ii stage of our technology and that there's a lot more to come in the future
with respect to dermacell i think with one year under the belt and with some more clinical data
factors that would tend to reduce our gross profit percentage include a shift in mix towards pinpoint and dermacell which are currently toward the lower end of our gross profit range
the top half of the sales team that is the top forty sales professionals generated revenue
as we conducted our planning for two thousand sixteen in the late summer broadly speaking our options were to either remain static in terms of the size of the sales team
and i think that we're starting at a much higher plateau this year because we have about eighty people who have experience
and the growth in imaging kit recurring revenue is a little bit less than that nine percent it's -- the recurring revenue is driven a little bit more by dermacell and we talked about that a little bit at the investor day
the change took place as of january one and i'm pleased to say that it has gone extremely well
so we sold a few more spy systems but in terms of the level of installations actually pinpoint is running ahead of spy
during our first quarter two thousand fifteen conference call we outlined some new metrics which we thought would be useful to monitor our progress going forward as a direct sales and marketing company
i think that if we can execute i think certainly luna will definitely start to produce
spy is actually we are getting new -- we are doing some placements of spy because some customers still want to do it on that basis which we're open to for a limited period of time
probably be the lead in the industry among the top ten or fifteen banks
with and without semm so going forward you can assume that this trend will continue and
and my second question is more general that you mentioned about semm and sme so i was wondering what is the difference between semm and as of sme in terms of loan size in terms of customer acquisition
and we don't expect that all of the patients will have been on treatment sufficiently long yet to have seen for the deepest possible response to have developed by the time at ash so
i imagine that the first one would be at asco next year b-mind remember is intended to be a pivotal study so that will be blinded and that we're in a safety run-in at the moment i think the next
we continue to expect a net loss in fiscal 'eighteen however we anticipate our second half results to show improvement over the first half as new customer orders have strengthened as anticipated
our teams have begun to renew our existing us and international service center capabilities
or there will be a telephonic replay -- will be available until may sixteen and the information on how to access these replay features is provided in yesterday's earnings release
moving on to our end-markets update on slide seven we have a diversified mix of revenues that are focused on some of the most active segments of the overall market
well i mean generally speaking rates remain under pressure and they certainly remain a challenge for us q one is probably the toughest quarter for us but like i said we're focused on it and we've already made some progress
on behalf of the entire five below team i would like to express our deep gratitude to david for his invaluable contributions since cofounding the company with tom thirteen years ago
including the greater philadelphia market which we have operated in since our inception in two thousand and two we believe the runway for store growth is long and the associated earnings potential is large
and we enjoy payback periods on our new store investment of under one year
assuming a two percent to three percent comparable store sales increase and the opening of approximately two net new stores
first question was i'm wondering if your q three products successes give us a read on the fourth quarter did you see better growth
that strategy is working and you'll see us continue to do that as we go into 'sixteen and 'seventeen and
even in some of your existing regions but maybe can you talk about how you're prioritizing some of the major new market opportunities over the next twelve to twenty four months
these statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could adversely affects five nine's future results
the next key integration is with microsoft skype for business uc our latest integration with skype allows agents to seamlessly connect to knowledge workers
i'm extremely proud of the entire five nine team and our strategic partners for bringing it all together with one goal in mind
we will be presenting at the keybanc global technology leadership forum in vail on august eight the twentieth annual oppenheimer technology internet
our channel program continues to grow nicely and is yielding results beyond our expectations for example bookings for master agents and resellers represented more than twenty five percent of our enterprise bookings in the second quarter
in the long run so that forty three percent was a bit of an aberration to some extent because we've been investing in thirty percent to forty percent growth in sales capacity we just turned up a few very large enterprises all at the same time
the improvements to adjusted ebitda continue to be driven by our enterprise business which enjoys excellent unit economics and is consistently increasing as a proportion of total revenue
this ongoing success in our enterprise business continues to be driven by six key factors
after a competitive process involving other cloud vendors five nine was selected for multiple reasons
i'm also extremely pleased to report that we had our best quarter ever for enterprise bookings in q two our pipeline reached another all-time high as well
as a fully integrated solution salesforce lightning opens up a whole new set of integration possibilities and five nine is at the forefront of innovation on this new platform
this customer is using five nine for its e-commerce customer service organization they were using a premise system that was expensive and required too many technical resources to maintain
this provides the agent with valuable insight to where the customer has been whether on their website or in the ivr and gives the agent insights into customer intentions prior to them even speaking to the customer
adjusting for this unfavorable impact our rasm performance looks to be at least on par with the industry
from the artificially depressed growth this year and that you'd get back to like a gdp-ish-like number in twenty nineteen on capacity
i was also pleased to see growth in average fares for the first time in about two years and despite some drag from our reservation system conversion
the fourth of july holiday timing softens the third quarter performance and the sequential comp to second quarter is harder with the full easter benefit showing up in the second quarter
our third quarter revenue trends were also impacted by the timing of the july fourth holiday as well as last year's outage which roughly offset each other on a unit basis
that we're only published through april and we are still working on what we want to do for the balance of twenty eighteen but i think conceptually all we're doing with the
we're not intending to grow aggressively at all next year although the percentage increase will be higher than twenty seventeen but we want to manage it in such a way that we drive
as noted in our earnings release the rasm pressure from the transition to our new reservation system is temporary and these items are relatively minor considering the significance of the technology efforts
and the new system for these three items does not work like the old system
and then we'll end the year with fourteen mike do you want to talk about the airplane and what you've heard from boeing and other operators around the world
mike i just want to ask real quick you talked about the max being more efficient now than when you ordered it is that just on fuel burn and can you talk about how that may have changed if that's what you were referring to
the decrease from our previous guidance reflects the timing of sales as well as the impacts of the special charges discussed earlier lastly turning to our fiscal two thousand and eighteen outlook
more appropriately reflect the ongoing operations of the business a reconciliation of these amounts is provided in the press release our accompanying slide deck and our quarterly report on form ten-q
in fiscal two thousand seventeen this expense was recorded in the second quarter whereas this year it was recorded in the first quarter
we now believe aerospace sales will be up approximately twelve percent and industrial sales will be down approximately seven percent both as compared to the prior year
low double digits really is quite good it's excellent but i don't hear anything from you now that suggests it goes to zero at the back end of the year which is what it needs to do to average of what you're talking about
fly leasing which we will refer to as fly or the company issued its second quarter earnings results press release which is posted on the company's website at flyleasingcom
statements regarding the outlook for the company's future business and financial performance forward-looking statements are based on current expectation and assumption of fly's management
okay that's awesome and then my other question is kind of more of a housekeeping question can you just explain the tax rate to me i kind of thought it would be lower than the twenty four percent that you booked in the quarter
actual outcomes and results may differ materially due to factors that are summarized in the earnings press release and described more fully in the company's filings with the sec
unfortunately for financial reporting purposes we must translate the total principal amount of the debt outstanding whereas on the other side only one quarter's rent is translated at the current exchange rates
as well as two substudies to test pamrevlumab in combination with either pirfenidone or nintedanib our principal focus in the substudies is on safety assessments of combination treatment
and in dialysis have epo therapy some of whom have iron support most of whom do not
were less responsive to epo in the comparator arm consistent with the published historical esa studies
based on our data we believe that the blockade of ctgf will be a more effective approach to fibrotic disease and multiple cancers
yielded threefold improvement in one year and doubling of median survival compared to outcomes with lower levels of circulating antibody
and so we're trying to focus on places where there are such compelling unmet medical needs as we expand beyond ckd dialysis
said at the beginning of the meeting that all that they talked about that day would apply to everything except for mds therapy and so everybody has recognized it's a very difficult situation that exists
without the type of dose increases observed in esas and without any iv iron
by way of hrct and -- so we are very excited to see what that looks like compared to placebo that's
and our progress in our china and us programs during the coming quarters and the opportunity to build momentum in our product development programs
the increase was due to higher volumes on our texas ngl pipelines and our mariner east system and higher throughput at the lone star fractionators partially offset by a decrease in our optimization and marketing group
while we continue to expect that we will not need to issue equity at least through the middle of this year we are targeting not having any equity needs in twenty eighteen and
now moving on to ete i'll begin with ete's fourth quarter results followed by a liquidity and financing update
refined product and ngl inventories associated with the legacy sxl business
due primarily to the timing of recognition of inventory gains and lower spreads in the butane lending business ngl transportation volumes on our wholly-owned and joint venture pipelines
partially offset by higher ebitda from the unconsolidated affiliates due to placing transpecos and comanche trail into service and higher natural gas sales from pipeline optimization activities
our construction and engineering groups remain committed to working closely with ferc pa dep and other regulatory agencies
we are nearing capacity in the midland basin and we'll need rebel two as soon as possible to meet growing producer demand in the region
from the lifo method to the weighted average cost method in order to be consistent with legacy etp's treatment of inventories these changes have been retrospectively applied to all periods presented
i'm also pleased to say that we have recently received authorization from ferc to resume hdd operations at the tuscarawas river for rover
and the contribution from major projects coming online we felt with etp's current cost of equity it was prudent to temporarily suspend the distribution growth
actually put that into refined product service when we bring two and two x on so as time goes on and when we finally openly bring two x on we have a multitude of options but what we've built is an incredible enterprise
this performance was driven by our generics business which benefited from important product launches as well as the continued growth of our xiaflex franchise
in two thousand seventeen the underlying rate of base business price erosion is likely to be high single digit
we are very excited about the prospects for xiaflex and recognize it to be a very valuable asset
in the first quarter of two thousand sixteen somar revenues were impacted by lower demand for certain products in mexico and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange
up to this point when we look at -- maybe i'll put a little color on the value i think that's probably important when we look at these twenty new products
from pure generic play and obviously we're preparing for success in xiaflex but we also have to keep our optionality open if we can place endo in a better position
in terms of the intellectual property surrounding xiaflex there are a number of -- there's a number of patents that are -- that have been granted
and are subject to the changes risks and uncertainties described in today's press release and in our us and canadian securities filings in addition
in today's earnings announcement the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures
we'll focus our efforts and resources behind xiaflex and its approved indications and in pursuing an indication
the fourth quarter base business revenue increased sequentially from the third quarter of two thousand sixteen the increase was due to the expected restocking in the quarter
and the impact of expected new competitive events in twenty seventeen with that said we expect our total generic segment to decline in the high single
so it's a little bit difficult for us to opine in terms of what the endgame is with the fda i think at this point in time we can say that our studies to date support the safety and efficacy
included in that as well just trying to get a sense of what the actual price erosion on the portfolio may be and then secondly with respect to new product launch expectations i think you talked about approximately twenty launches
when we look at new product launches for twenty seventeen we say we have about twenty products i would tell you that we have a
from a revenue standpoint so we want to get that out there but i think it's also important to talk maybe just a little bit of the carryover for zetia and quetiapine because they're so big contributors to what we're doing so when you look at those two products
that paul talked about as well as the cost savings initiatives that we have been driving and then in terms of the claris one impact
and that may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies
in addition we continue to have a hundred percent share of the potassium chloride liquid market and have been growing our potassium powder market share nicely
driven primarily by expected high single to low double-digit growth for xiaflex only a small portion of the diagnosed patient population for each of the xiaflex indications have actually been treated
how many of those do you actually have a relatively high degree of visibility on in terms of either specific date certain packet expiration or a settlement obviously the fda hasn't been doing
what are your assumptions around competition in guidance for 'seventeen on both the liquid and powder and then i have a quick follow-up
to the best of our knowledge we believe at this point in time that we have not been noticed from any paragraph iv filers so it think it's probably maybe the best way to
and the incremental investments in product and sales capacity all generally in line with the q one expectations we set for you last quarter
shipments to the aftermarket channel declined two percent on a tough prior year compare the warmer weather we experienced during the quarter and a bit of pull forward of demand that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year
in addition we will use certain non-gaap measures in our discussion and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items
additionally we announced the retirement of two longstanding board members effective as of the upcoming annual shareholders meeting in early march
so let's move to slide eleven and get into the details with the look at the performance of buildings on a consolidated basis
we do expect continued pricing pressure in our china field businesses as we look into q two but we're going to work to offset that headwind with cost actions
given the significance and complexity of us tax reform we continue to analyze all aspects of the new legislation and may adjust this onetime charge as necessary over the course of the year
and so you can imagine we booked margin much better than that in the quarter that brought the average up about thirty basis points
in discussing our results during the call references to adjusted ebita and adjusted ebit margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items
turning to slide five i do want to spend a minute highlighting our new york yz centrifugal chiller which was launched in early january
asia pacific orders increased nine percent driven by strong growth in china
with an effective interest rate of essentially zero percent for a term of three years
which reflects our initial estimate of the impact of tax reform in fiscal 'eighteen this includes a onetime noncash tax benefit
i think i'd focus on a couple things first of all as it relates to the fourth quarter there is a huge push in q four and that tends to be
the yz represents a significant milestone in our product development journey and will become the new flagship in our chiller portfolio
particularly in hvac we remain focused on developing innovative new products and expanding our channel presence and we are gaining share as a result
you can see in the margin waterfall that the combined benefit of a hundred and thirty basis points from cost synergy and productivity save
we do anticipate our fiscal 'nineteen tax rate to increase to a range of sixteen percent to eighteen percent based upon the effective dates of certain provisions of the new legislation
so i think when you look at the power margins as george said it's a hundred basis points in the first quarter that transportation and logistics will probably continue
throughout twenty seventeen as a reminder we are also in the process to developing our patent pending molded structural composite technology that we believe will have broad applications in the dry and refrigerated truck body and refrigerated space
at the macro level in terms of total equipment purchases for twenty sixteen we've seen overall industry projections revised downward in recent updates
which took effect on october one with this appointment we've established an enhanced leadership structure to provide more effective and coordinated oversight
our work is far from over to bring this business to desirable levels of performance but avte backlog is now at its highest level of the year and we are well positioned to finish twenty sixteen on a positive note
to summarize we remain pleased by the overall margin performance of the businesses during the past two years as key markets had continued to contract along with strong potential presented by new product offerings already developed or in development within the group
so in terms of earnings for full year twenty sixteen recognizing the productivity and cost optimization momentum that was displayed in the first three quarters
and the outlook for 'seventeen has been cut as well are you trying to make a distinction between what's expected on the tractor side versus the trailer side
as we look at the next several kind of quarters matched up with the order season which we said has kind of pushed out into the q four q one time frame -- we're not looking at material costs that are terribly dissimilar to where we were at this time last year
with that it's my pleasure to turn the call over to dick giromini CEO thanks mike the third quarter marked another excellent quarter for the company and delivered bottom line results that were among the best in the company's history
which runs through the end of two thousand and seventeen let me now touch on a few specific financial highlights from the third quarter
the ctp team remains very excited about the entry into the truck body market in order to take advantage of future growth in the final mile and home delivery space truck body
first announced to the market in october of twenty fifteen we have successfully commercialized the molded structural composite refrigerated truck body and have been successful meeting early stage growth targets
while it is still too early to put any firm numbers around twenty seventeen trailer projections
from dpg however not wanting to rest on any of these accomplishments we will continue our focused efforts to drive ongoing improvements throughout the business
it's exactly the reason why we did the diversification and the acquisition we did in two thousand and twelve and potentially setting up very nicely to see those benefits over the next couple of years so
there are four unique features to remodulin as it is today
today's remarks may also include financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures can be found in our earnings release
this decrease in the seasonal loss was largely due to colder weather across our service territory which resulted in nineteen percent higher natural gas retail volumes across all service territories
at the end of the second quarter mdu filed with the north dakota public service commission an advance determination of prudence to purchase the expansion
we continue to be optimistic about the opportunities in front of us and believe that our one billion tons of aggregate reserves located in strong markets across the company
at mdu resources we are committed to operating with integrity and a continue to focus on safely and creating superior shareholder value while building a strong america
influences on the pipeline between the two i think your initial question vikram was about
i certainly appreciate all of your interest and commitment to mdu resources i now ask that we open the lines to questions that you may have
for a discussion of factors that may cause actual results to differ refer to item one a risk factors in our most recent form ten-k
our second quarter results show the strength of our two-platform business model as higher earnings at the utility and construction services businesses
we're also pleased about the continued returns to our shareholders through dividend payments as we have paid a dividend now for seventy nine straight years and increased it for the last twenty six consecutive years
thank you for your interest in mdu resources and for taking the time to join us today to discuss our second quarter results
we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet currently with equity at fifty seven percent of total capital which is stronger than the fifty three percent level we're at the same time last year
regardless the provisions above ninety days as a percentage of revenues and
between renewable and conventional generation and four percent from other businesses such as commercialization services and other businesses that are growing in the company
we had an increase in our ebitda in this first quarter of 'seventeen and in the bottom left chart we also have a significant increase
we went back and looked at the last eight years just to give you context for this first year's half redemptions this year's first half would be sixth
air products contributed total return of minus eighty basis points for the quarter represents -- again the numbers i'm giving as a percentage of capital are consolidated for the whole firm the actual numbers for the private funds are lower
in january of two thousand and thirteen a few weeks after our presentation look at what they've said to their investors look at the impact that it's had on the stock price
in the compensation the company is permitted to pay so present comp levels remain only if they hit an eighty percent figure which is very significant
what they chose to do was negotiate a settlement with the harshest findings that the ftc has ever had against a pyramid scheme
so there are four categories of transactions now that distributors can be compensated for by the company that they can get multilevel marketing compensation on they're sales to people in the preferred customer category
and then this analysis doesn't assume kind of further regulatory action by other us ags by international regulators and doesn't assume there's any knock-on effect on the international distributor network
in the first and second quarter eased a little and mro strengthened of it
we believe end markets bottomed in two thousand and sixteen and we saw solid sequential improvement through the first quarter which we attributed half to market and half to share gains
and in commercial markets we saw modest improvement in our uk markets with an extremely strong quarter in canada us municipal markets also continued to perform as expected
just given the mix -- some of the mix elements that we see and we'll likely finish on the full year about fifty basis points better than our guidance so we're going to beat our guidance overall and
thinking back to your -- through the cycle target of three percent to five percent plus maybe a couple of points i think you got the microwave award in one q is that kind of what the base case should be at this point
and then at our annual investor day event scheduled for march one in new york city thank you for your interest in crane and have a fantastic day
overall volume decreased fifteen percent due to lower yields from our sourcing areas in costa rica
and the philippines and we reduced expenses in tomato production by replacing our own us-based production with new grower relationships in mexico
with bananas reaching their lowest selling price in ten years in europe during the second quarter
your business did so well in 'sixteen it provides a tough comp can you give us just kind of like the building blocks like bigger building blocks of puts and takes
can you talk about in the next two to three years how much do you think that -- it seems like now you're really kind of getting to the point of critical mass in this specialty business
these declines were partially offset by stronger volumes in apac and emea like last quarter
we continue to right size the business and accelerated our planned closures of two facilities in brazil this year
as we have explained in our business model these pricing actions typically require three to six months to take full effect
we expect our emea region to have higher net sales compared to the prior year
so if we had to look sequentially december to september should we think of it up down kind of help on the ebit line for south america would be appreciated
in addition group contribution increased over eight percent during the quarter which provides evidence that meeting planners are continuing to spend at their events
they may not be updated in the future these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's sec filings
is important to note that room revenues only declined oh point seven percent as a result of the additional day in february and the addition of the new rooms at the boston hilton
utility expenses were down eight percent partially due to the more moderate winter and group commissions were lower as a result of less group business
second we expect the challenges in new york city to continue and the results for the two thousand sixteen market revpar in new york city
pretty substantially in the last three years at this hotel so we've been waiting a little bit to get that ebitda back up to where we think it should be
rather early on and so for the time being for the next one year or two we expect the profit level to remain low now as for the profit improvement businesses
given the significant unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities after having issued a significant amount of term debt over the past nine months
continued to generate solid growth in their aggregate earnings as the weighted average ebitda growth over the past twelve months
approximately sixty percent of these new investments were to incumbent borrowers and more than half of these investments were in first lien secured positions
from the acas acquisition is providing a nice tailwind we continue to manage the company in what we believe to be a prudent fashion and in the same manner that we've operated over the last fourteen years and we believe that should serve us well even if the environment becomes more difficult
section of the website ares capital corporation's earnings release and ten-q are also available on the company's website
we also saw a reduction in the number of companies on nonaccrual during the first quarter we had three companies come off of nonaccrual compared to one new nonaccrual investment
and when you buy a very large portfolio at a discount to nav and you hold it through a rising multiple environment you find yourself in a good position to exit and generate gains which is what we've done but
the company believes that core eps provides useful information to investors regarding financial performance because it is one method the company uses to measure its financial condition and results of operations
which is our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential core earnings improvement since the first quarter of two thousand and seventeen when we closed the american capital acquisition
we currently are only closing on about three percent to four percent of the transactions we review for new companies
very simply if no other action is taken by a bdc other than adopting the change in the asset coverage ratio the probability of default for all of our lenders decreases
at four percent you can do the math as to even if you max the leverage ratio out to some number that i don't think we're remotely close to talking about here
to deliver on these commitments we continue to focus our energy capital and resources on executing against our three strategic priorities
while acknowledging a disappointing q three i want to be clear that we have one hundred percent confidence in our growth strategy and the sustainability of the leadership position we have built in the market
our us real estate strategy will be driven by placing the majority of our new stores throughout middle america and the south with careful consideration of the format type
having been in china since nineteen ninety nine the strength of our brand the trust we have built with our customers and partners and our working knowledge of the many nuances of the china market uniquely positions us for continued long-term success
over the next three years is critical and the reason we grew transactions in the mid-teens in china is because of new-store growth and it is where
and reinforce our strategic priorities going forward then i'll turn the call over to roz and belinda to report on our q three operating performance in each of our two key markets
and the addition of six million digitally registered customers who are not yet rewards members but who have established a digital connection with starbucks
the impact of frappuccino decline and the store closures to support the anti-bias training is estimated to be three points of comp in the quarter
as we close out fiscal twenty eighteen most of our targets remain consistent with previous guidance but i'd like to highlight a few specifics
within the cap segment we continue to expect operating margin to be down moderately in fiscal twenty eighteen relative to last year due to the consolidation of east china
i would just broaden the middle america part to definitely talk about the broad swath of the southern us
sustainability is one of three of our social impact priorities our aspiration to make coffee the first sustainable agricultural product is in direct support of coffee farmers around the world
finally in q three we did experience higher-than-expected levels of sales transfer from existing stores to new stores due primarily to the acceleration of new store openings in the first half of the year
two we have learned from our nineteen-year experience and developed a very strong brand
cap reported eleven percent revenue growth after adjusting for thirty five points of streamline activities and fx with china revenue growth once again in the high teens on the same basis
we continue to expect consolidated revenue growth in the high single digits excluding approximately two points of favorability from the east china acquisition and other streamline-driven activities
excluding this impact we continue to expect cap operating margin to be moderately higher year-over-year
first of all what we've talked about is one point of system sales and just to roll forward system sales the last time we talked about it was in our
additionally we divested two nonstrategic product lines in the quarter and we did a third here in the first part of october
but also remember we don't have a single customer within idex that represents more than two percent of our sales and so there has been some -- we've seen some commentary lately suggesting that it's substantially higher than that
as we begin a brief reminder this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in today's press release and in idex's filings with the securities and exchange commission
before i do that however let me talk a little bit about what we're seeing in our core markets and geographies really the trends remain the same from what we've been talking about for the last three quarters or so
we've got a great balance sheet strong free cash flows and a good acquisition pipeline as we think about the balance of twenty sixteen and certainly into the future
and so with the things that we have sold we have sold them principally to people who have one of two things either a different expectation of long-term performance than we have
but if i think five years from now or ten years from now compared to where we are today and the unit volume that you would expect it's going to be much much much higher and that's the bet we're making
if you're expecting organic up about one in the fourth quarter and we were kind of down two this quarter could you maybe tell us the segments where you see that delta coming from
and we've had great results from that and a bunch of those businesses sit in the fmt portfolio and i really should say i should add price right we continue to get positive price
but the story is a good new story we've seen strength in those markets we expect to see strength in those markets going forward and for those to be above the idex average in terms of growth
i think provides a huge opportunity for us ott is clearly
but i do have a significant level of confidence that as we move into twenty eighteen given our pipeline and given where i know those deals are in the pipeline and the magnitude of them
and slightly higher than the first quarter of two thousand sixteen we believe this metric reflects the strength of our portfolio of events and the important role they play in the exhibitors' businesses
we also launched two new shows in the period an east coast active collective event
our asd winter show which is included in our q one financials was flat in revenues
over the last month we've seen some further deterioration in the outlooks for both of these shows as their pace of sales did not keep up with our expectations as well as reductions in our forecast for the new york now and asd summer shows for the aforementioned reasons
our estimated range for full year organic revenue growth of zero percent to two percent reflects good growth in many of our brands
following the ipo and the resulting reduction in our leverage we took the opportunity to refinance our credit facility to reduce the interest rate payable
i am particularly excited to have announced the acquisition yesterday of the sia snow show the leading national ski and snowboard b two b trade show expanding and strengthening our position within the outdoor sports and recreation sector
so it was more introduced as a pop-up show post holiday that we thought might have some legs and it just didn't and as we've noted in the past we don't expect a a hundred percent hit rate on all new launches of shows we'll have a fairly good hit rate
all three transactions were structured as asset-purchase deals and two of the three shows were acquired from trade associations and in all three cases were private sales and not public auctions
despite efforts made by our outdoor retailer team to mitigate the effect of the political situation over recent weeks it has become clear that the adverse impact on the revenues of the summer twenty seventeen show will likely be more
versus two thousand sixteen we plan to reallocate and shift some of the internal resources towards faster new exhibitor acquisition and new category expansion
the guidance going out do you have two or three additional shows already factored into that in addition to the two that you already opened this year or that be on the come based on when they open
we are starting to observe the use of micro proppants in complex completions with some two hundred mesh sand being incorporated into some stimulation program core continues to test
on june nineteen we amended and extended our revolving credit facility for an additional five years under substantially the same terms as our previous agreement
the breakthrough eds technology enables a diagnostic tracer element to be absorbed and chemically bonded to the durable proppant-sized particles that accompany the frac sand eds has rapidly become the preferred method for monitoring completion success
into reservoir description just hasn't happened yet we thought we would see some of that in q three now we expect some of that in q four but
if indeed the international spend next year is up ten percent we would still guide our revenue
reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is included in the press release announcing our second quarter results those non-gaap financial measures
and then larry will go over core's two operating segments detailing our progress
which continues to improve and is significantly improved from the eighty one percent for the same quarter last year we continue to see improvements in our operating leverage and the absorption of our fixed costs on higher levels of product sales
with some recovery factors increasing from an average of about nine percent into the low and mid-teens
inventory turns have remained consistent in the first half of two thousand eighteen and we expect our inventory turns to show improvement throughout the remainder of the year
core is helping the client understand how the co two injection will affect the chemical and physical properties of the reservoir fluid
in the third quarter of two thousand and eighteen and we know significant challenges await however we have never been better operationally or technology positioned to help our clients to maintain and expand their existing production base
from a change in tax accounting rules for stock-based compensation as well as the continued growth of tllp's income in proportion to tesoro's income
we closed the acquisition of great northern midstream in january and expect to offer it to tllp for acquisition in the second half of this year
along the way we're required to do some additional work on permitting that was unexpected last summer when we developed our plans and that's moved that project out so all three projects the delays are attributable to
taking our plans and putting them into implementation so we have a new leader that has taken over responsibility for our marketing business that joined just two weeks ago
how we allocate capital to the growth of tllp that creates the most value whether it be through
about how we see the retail sales but the demand continues to improve so not only did we get the growth in demand in 'fourteen we have growth in demand in 'fifteen we're seeing growth in demand in 'sixteen and so the
well first paul let me state we will receive the permit in la there's nothing out there that tells us -- i mean it provides tremendous benefits
in the last six years and they're pricing very attractively into the west coast so it is the
the full physical integration of the carson and wilmington operations yield flexibility of between thirty thousand to forty thousand barrels a day of gasoline and distillates and
we will invest in salt lake city to be able to get to tier three gasoline and then we'll balance out the rest of our system to be able to be in compliance with it
as i stated we feel comfortable in every area except for crude differentials and i guess a way to look at your own sensitivity on that is we run about three hundred million barrels of crude a year and if our index is
at the beginning of this year we expect to drop that down in the second part of two thousand sixteen and an acquisition that we'll be making in alaska with some additional
being low especially in the first two months of the year our results were driven by strong performance in our marketing and logistics businesses and demonstrate our ability to leverage our highly integrated business model
that project you can now see more of the light at the end of the tunnel than we have for some time the hearings are formally set for the end of june through about thirty days so the latter part of july
are all in line with our expectations for two thousand and sixteen margins in marketing are at the high end as fuel volumes continue to grow however
looking ahead we remain well positioned to drive improvements in the business and deliver on the plan we presented in december of two thousand and fifteen we look forward to updating you as we progress
and the public comment if they stick to the schedule will conclude actually shortly here within the next two or three weeks and then they'll go into the final phase before they issue the permit
as you know we have entered into an acquisition agreement with an affiliate of centre lane partners llc to divest our vitamin world business and certain other assets
however as we signaled last quarter q one performance was broadly in line with our strategy
business growth was led by solgar number seven joint comfort product as well as new innovation
the optics of the quarter were affected by the impact of last year's hurricanes also some shipment slid from late q two into early q three which is not unusual around the holidays
our second quarter includes thirty one days of pinnacle's results we remain excited about the opportunities presented by the combined portfolio
so to sum up pinnacle for now the deterioration in the legacy pinnacle business over the course of calendar year twenty eighteen means we have some hard work to do
we prepared the bridge to first show legacy conagra eps drivers followed by the pinnacle adjusted operating profit and net incremental capital costs associated with the acquisition
and our synergy commitments and now we are glad we did because while we are starting from a lower base we anticipate delivering strong eps growth off of that new base
as you can see on slide eight we continued to drive growth based on strong fundamentals tied to the strength of our brands
our results here tell a tale of two cities based on where we have applied our playbook and where we have not the segment overall is up fifty basis points with frozen driving all of the growth
the addition of pinnacle expands our presence in our most strategic categories including frozen foods and snacks and brings together two complementary portfolios of iconic brands
slide fourteen emphasizes once again how the strength of our brands is allowing us to capture growth the right way
slide nineteen shows some of the innovation we introduced which includes new varieties and on-trend flavors and reflects our focus on optimizing price pack architecture with multiple product configurations
and then to try to jump-start volume low roi trade was infused behind price promotion
obviously that accretion translated to an absolute eps number in our models
and accordingly last year's innovation was named after a portion size it was called perfect size for one and that cake frame of reference was highly limited
i want you to just be very clear where we stand on this overall we are very pleased with our top line strength i think you could see from our presentation and i'm talking legacy cag here
on the three businesses i talked about as you can imagine once you're cut you've got a pathway to get back in but it's not going to be with the exact same items that have just been discontinued you've basically got to rebuild
is that we have made some decisions to pull low roi programs which
in the data and do you see the resultant impact -- or the reversal in your velocities such that this is going to prove to be a one-year divot because your velocities are so strong there is almost
can innovate them in ways that drive good profitability and do a fantastic job delighting the consumer when you look at what we've done with our conagra brands over the last four years
and that is what we've got to correct with exactly the things you're talking about which is a return to superior execution on the three key leadership brands that we talked about today it means not
as one of the final pieces of the legacy conagra portfolio to receive attention our refrigerated products still appear on the shelf today largely the same way they did in the nineties and it shows in the results
our products were well received and we expect to continue to build on the strong momentum we delivered in the quarter as these new innovations hit the market in twenty nineteen so we feel good about our momentum in the legacy conagra business
while there was plenty of innovation activity over the past two years the results clearly show the innovation was insufficient to sustain growth primarily because it was subpar in its execution
as i mentioned we are absolutely stopping the initiatives that we can responsibly stop but most of our new work won't be ready to show customers until well into calendar twenty nineteen as a result
okay so a very good morning to everybody and welcome to ipc's second quarter
that we have in france seven million of those sit within those triassic reservoirs so that can help to unlock the value of some of those resources so we expect by the end of the year to get to
is being sold at prices with a slight premium to brent the balance comes from canada just under forty percent and we did see improvement in our oil prices in absolute terms
strong cash flow we've been able to significantly reduce the acquisition financing that we took on back on the five th of january to conclude
in terms of the canadian question and the q four drilling we actually don't expect there to be really any material production impact in the fourth quarter on those wells by the time that they're tied in
that should be finished in twenty nineteen we are strengthening our competitive position through the technology pilot but also that we are utilizing the technological capability and confidence in the company
towards our first year goal of securing one hundred million covered lives by the end of this year
for the full procedure so all-in it's going to take at least ninety days to get them certified just because of the duration of the sensor
and we even see that to gradually increase over the next five years
looking into twenty eighteen we see that the contract that we talked about earlier in china related to some market share gains will not have any material impact going forward
if we look on our own business we see increasing traction on our four g portfolio as well as five g portfolio and we have announced a number of wins during the fourth quarter
all of this of course based on the current visibility and the FX rates that we have at the moment
the second major oem deal that i'm very happy to announce on this call is with samsung one of the largest manufacturers of smart tvs globally
available to the company's twenty four million user base has an expansion into live sports programming
as illustrated by this wave of deals i just outlined we are aggressively taking advantage of the rapidly growing and high potential avod ott market segment
but also from a business model perspective the financial profile of avod revenues is extremely appealing because it is less capital intensive
which standardizes contracted revenue recognition across companies worldwide we now provide revenue breakdowns of our ott streaming and related digital revenues
this new system will allow for better controlled data basing of our content rights as well as enabling us to speed up the delivery of massive volumes of content to digital and ott platforms worldwide
we are also aggressively building our presence in the high-growth high-margin avod market through new channels platform partnerships and licensing deals
in the earnings release i know there's some disclosure in the ebitda table what additional color can you give on that or do we have to wait for the q
that means there is a big and growing opportunity to provide robust free avod offerings for viewers who want much more content
requires less upfront and ongoing investment in content than the subscription vod business and continues to utilize our existing library of content
in making these changes we believe investors will have a clearer view of the primary focus of our strategy which is to build our streaming ott network business
this is required for us to continue to be a leader in the ott space particularly in the rapidly growing avod segment that chris described
as evidenced by the tubi roku and xumo agreements i also discussed
period so this is really q two so we're trying to get our legs around the types of metrics that we can start to be consistent with
that model has generated engagement eight times higher than average depending on the specific device used
we currently have more than two dozen similar distribution deals in the pipeline at various stages of negotiation
and much more diversity and breadth of content than what those two to three subscription services that they are generally willing to pay for have to offer
this focus on avod will continue to enhance our unique ability to generate four separate revenue streams off of the huge ott streaming ecosystem
who introduced exotic shanghai and greater china to us readers before world war ii and is based on extensive
we develop our own internal irr and investment strategies based on what it takes for us to get a specific return of more than twenty five percent after tax
it's everything you said it's a combination of all of that remember we've taken a pivot now we have a base subscription business and we've moved over to this avod concept so you're looking at
talking in right now december thirty one so the facility will start to move up
we expect other channels to launch on this platform in two thousand nineteen in the coming quarters
with each new launch or individual platform deal we are potentially adding five or six figures per deal in monthly revenues steady state
so the demand for quality avod offerings is clearly huge and will continue to grow rapidly as more and more consumers make their choices in the ott space
where most of our competitors can only generate a single ott revenue stream
we are rapidly moving forward with content supply arrangements and programming strategies for this new ott channel with several top chinese entertainment companies and will announce the specifics soon
in addition to the consolidation of segments referred to above and the renaming we also provide ott streaming and related digital revenues
different categories of chinese content films and tv programs out there for a western audience to actually view
are you talking about the ott revenues what's your specific question
anything specific you guys can attribute that to specifically here for q four one of it is simply the mathematical outcome
and part of that is due to some of the marketing and operating -- particularly marketing efficiency issues we've been talking about the last six to nine months
if you bring it into mexico from china it's thirty percent if you bring it into brazil from china it's forty percent so what you want to do is look and say well
is that nobody expected the chinese government to come out and say that chinese ladies could now have two babies
moreover in the more than thirty years that i have been involved with lakeland the company has never been better positioned and presented with more global opportunities than it is today
our cash is being invested to secure two new facilities in asia and southeast asia these facilities will start to come online at the end of our fiscal two thousand nineteen first quarter or in about nine months from now
or half of one percentage point of sales as we continue to build out our sales force to accelerate growth in the markets
we're looking at everything to be a thirty percent return on investment on the cash that we have and the heavy equipment does not provide that so that will come last
the ladies who are doing the sewing it takes about six months for them to get up to standard
chinese textile production so it's really who the customer is really when you come down to it and if you have -- we sell in forty countries and the first thing i always ask is what's the tariff into that country
total work number records are now approaching ninety million and i think as you know from your experience with the company
getting to be about flat in three q and slightly positive in four q the impact of the mortgage market on equifax growth is significant in the first half of 'nineteen impacting total revenue negatively
shifting to the technology transformation we started in twenty eighteen it's critical to the delivery of all of our strategic imperatives and will provide us with substantial product delivery and cost advantages
by the latter part of twenty nineteen this same process will be followed to build new applications or migrate existing applications going forward
we made strong steps forward in the fourth quarter and we'll continue our efforts in twenty nineteen and twenty twenty as we complete elements of our multiyear plan on a monthly basis going forward
protecting the resources and technology resources around npi was critical to us
the weakness in australia and argentina through the first half are expected to impact international revenue growth negatively by about two percent in the first half of the year
this does not include the cost of any potential judgments or other outcomes should they occur for the status of the legal and regulatory matters i would refer you to our ten-k
safe to say the vast majority of the investment in change is completed by the end of twenty twenty and as part of that would it be reasonable to think that you'd begin to see some benefits
mark provided a perspective on total incremental spending on security and technology transformation over the twenty eighteen to 'twenty period
and the weakening of the demand towards the end of the year was another hit -- we took another hit from that on our ebit in after sales
bank accounts the outlook the weak market environment also led to a low demand in the first two months of 'nineteen the momentum has not changed
the highlights as an introduction as a summary i already told you about the order intake seventeen percent less
the order intake went down by thirty percent business group after sales also had a little decline and the reason here is that in the after sales business we also report the installation
these measures include a reduction of our global workforce of around five percent i told you in january that we are now going through what we call in rieter the cycle management
for our project in ingolstadt included and we didn't have that in 'eighteen so that is the major change here the dividend proposal i already
in the past you were expecting about thirty million spindles that should have been more or less the normal average
and finally all comparative references will be to the first quarter of twenty sixteen unless we state otherwise now i will turn the call over to joe thanks diana
with this framework in mind let's turn to page four and look at our first quarter's results where you can see the earnings per share amounts
while catastrophe losses were also elevated in the first quarter of two thousand sixteen we are comfortable with our long-term pricing expectations and do not anticipate fundamentally changing our pricing or underwriting actions due to these storms
turning to investments on page nine this function continues to be an area of strength for kemper we manage a diversified and highly rated portfolio that has performed well over time
and turning to page five we have isolated sources of volatility in our earnings in the highlighted section at the bottom of the page you can see that excluding these items underlying operating performance has improved over the past year
also as i mentioned last quarter we are currently having discussions with a number of banks to obtain a larger and more flexible credit facility our goal is to have something in place by the end of fiscal q three i'll now turn the call over to ted
taking into account our results through the first six months of our fiscal year current market conditions in north dakota and the impact of recent sale activity
compared with one year ago the level of market activity for projects and turnarounds that we are experiencing is healthier
these two developments reinforce our belief that there is significant opportunity for growth in providing products and services to operators focused on pipeline integrity
serving not only safran but also some of their suppliers our german business has benefited from strong turnaround activity and our uk business has rebounded and is showing significant improvement compared with prior year
we are likewise pleased with the first half twenty eighteen results from our international segment
we achieved a record level of quarterly revenue in our services segment despite the impact of a large contract discontinuing using our services at the beginning in april twenty eighteen as we previously disclosed
ed will now take us through our financials for q two in more detail afterwards i will summarize our initiatives and update our expectations going forward thank you dennis
can be found in the tables contained in yesterday's press release and in our related current report on form eight-k
the double-digit organic revenue gain was the primary driver to improved results as significant improvements were noted in each of our three largest european operations
these reports are available on the company's website in the investors section and on the sec's website
and what we experienced in the spring of twenty eighteen represents a catch-up on some of those deferrals customer indications suggest that we should see a relatively normal remainder
yes this is dennis we believe that the market is coming back we see a strong fall year all we're trying to say is that we did have a strong fall of 'seventeen as well so comparably it may not look as
of well the only thing that's different for the second half is we have two quarters of missing that large contract versus the one that we had in the first quarter -- or in the first half because in the first half we had a full first quarter of the contract and only missed it in the second
bringing it up a little bit in uk as well so we don't really have so much difference in that it's just when we have a strong utilization their margins are very very good it's really what we have to be careful of is making sure we can forecast going forward and watch our utilization
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in the company's most recent annual report on form ten-k
had a smaller operating loss in q two and we are optimistic that the benefits of an improved sales backlog will drive this segment to profitability
our results should reflect this dynamic despite our previously disclosed loss of a large contract within our services segment commencing at the beginning of q two which we are working hard to offset with organic growth
we are confident in continuing margin expansion in our services segment for the remainder of twenty eighteen over the prior year
due in part to the beneficial impact of our twenty seventeen acquisitions
valuable to the customers we serve and make them want to be able to use our services in a faster way the cui crawlers those were again just another way of
i am pleased to say that we have made considerable progress on these goals in the first four quarters and we are a different westport fuel systems today
we have come a long way in four quarters but there is still more work to be done
with the objective of putting them behind us by the end of two thousand seventeen this will allow us to concentrate on growing in two thousand eighteen and beyond
so bear with us as we get through this and move into the -- as we close out quarter three i think the discussions will have a lot more clarity to them
i assume that you're talking more around the lng i would tell you that -- and andrea has got some great statistics on where we are built out relative to cng and lng in the european markets but
just a matter of getting vehicles there that can use the lng infrastructure that's already in place
as we move into 'eighteen since all the engines will be the zero equivalent this will also position us quite well for additional growth
corporate and technology looking at our automotive business our focus in the past four quarters has been on integrating the company and transforming our operating performance
into using lng and that has also enabled infrastructure to be quite nicely built out at this point in time so we're -- we work with a variety of different fuel
and so we prefer to wait until q three in order to understand
we will discuss some non-gaap measures in talking about our company's performance you can find the reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call
one of the clear highlights of q four is our net new active number
on the same basis this growth rate dropped to zero in the fourth quarter for the first time in two years revenue declined versus the prior year's quarter
growth in our p two p business continued deceleration of ebay and lower cross-border volumes contributed to the reduction in transaction take rate
in two thousand nineteen we will continue to balance investment with return of capital while maintaining an efficient capital structure
to continue to be a headwind in q one we expect non-gaap earnings per share
at least with paypal an average of about three times so we think we can help small businesses through these new capabilities
the fx so i'm just curious is that the right way to think about it that the core business outside of that is accelerating and if there's anything else in there
we processed just shy of ten billion transactions in the year
we are targeting more than three hundred million active accounts on our platform
this segment of our business is now much larger and faster-growing than our legacy ebay marketplace business and we expect this growth to continue in twenty nineteen as we expand our current partnerships and welcome new partners onto our platform
those merchants that are using paypal to sell across multiple channels already grow at nearly three times the rate of those that sell on only one marketplace
it means a lot to all of us at paypal that our platform can be used to make such a large difference to nonprofits and charities across the globe twenty eighteen was a strong year for us
total take rate in q four was flat sequentially and down twenty basis points from the prior year primarily as a result of the receivable sale
in two thousand nineteen we plan to deliver operating margin expansion with continued operating leverage and efficiencies more than offsetting this dilutive effect
a little bit lower than the midpoint but as we look at what transpired during the quarter there are two things that stand out
the diversity of our portfolio given that we've got so many different geographies in which we operate as well as so many different product offerings that we have but those are the two things that stand out
and involve risks and uncertainties these statements include our guidance for first quarter and full year twenty nineteen our medium-term guidance and the impact and timing of our acquisitions our actual results may differ materially from these statements
i'm pleased to report that paypal had another strong quarter ending twenty eighteen with a record-breaking growth across a number of key customer and financial metrics
helping to address that issue is a huge opportunity for consumers and is yet another way that our two-sided platform is connecting consumers
despite this geographic and product diversification including from our acquisitions venmo monetization and our growing apac business allowed us to continue to deliver solid revenue growth
i'd now like to discuss our guidance for the full year and the first quarter of two thousand and nineteen the guidance we are providing today is in line with the preliminary outlook we provided in october when we reported our third quarter results
we expect to welcome additional partnerships throughout twenty nineteen i'd like to end my remarks by recognizing the extraordinary generosity of our customers
the diversity of our business is allowing us to maintain our guidance ranges while absorbing a number of headwinds as we enter two thousand and nineteen while the lack of ebay growth remains a challenge
so at the end of our operating agreement which is eighteen months from now when they finally move into intermediated payments which
kind of like a same-store sales number or something or alternatively what tpv will look like when these users reach the level of activity that you see among your average user
the increase in the gross profit rate for the first quarter of twenty seventeen reflected a favorable channel mix shift
the tax rate for the first quarter of two thousand and seventeen reflects the offsetting effect of the valuation allowance established against our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal two thousand and sixteen due to this offsetting impact
and governance of it projects that we identified at the end of fiscal year two thousand and sixteen during the first quarter as part of the remediation plan we established an it steering committee
after the prepared remarks management will be available to take your questions for as long as time permits now i'll turn the call over to brendan
and decreased discounts from the liquidation of excess inventory in the first quarter of fiscal twenty sixteen partially offset by higher allowances and supply chain costs
we expect any tax expense or benefit for the company in fiscal twenty seventeen will be near zero to further explain this any tax rate used to generate an income tax expense or benefit
which has adopted a comprehensive information technology governance policies and procedures additional details regarding our remediation plan can be found in our ten-q
as we think about the rest of twenty seventeen we have added back our pre-fall delivery in the second quarter which we eliminated last year
this will dovetail nicely with our overall marketing efforts as we are looking to bring the brand back to our la roots and build a story around our luxury product that allows her to be fashionable and very effortless in low-key way we
on our last call we discussed the agreement we had entered into but not yet closed to acquire two terminals
with the leverage ratio covenant in our credit facility and includes the ebitda we expect to generate
we expect this initial phase two project to begin to come online by the end of this year
as mentioned on our third quarter call bostco and our florida terminals were left structurally unharmed by the hurricanes harvey and irma which impacted the gulf coast region over the summer
and be fully complete by the end of q one twenty nineteen in addition to this initial
was driven by contributions from our phase one collins growth project coming fully on revenue during twenty seventeen fourth quarter revenue
phase two buildout we are currently in active discussions with several other existing and prospective customers regarding future incremental capacity at collins
this decrease is attributable to a decrease in earnings from our share of the bostco facility
my colleague jesper and i will now report on our company's performance in the last nine months we will also give you an outlook for the coming months
and our target for working capital remains to be single digit within the next eighteen months
in the consumer segment despite that we also continue to see fx headwinds as a few examples of the efficiency program
in accordance with our conditional approval from the european commission we are also preparing for the successful divestiture of certain assets of our crop protection business to fmc after the closing of the merger with dow
as shown on slide eleven we are excited about our new seed and crop protection product pipeline
we urge you to review dupont's sec filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
we expect to close the merger in august of this year with the fmc transaction closing in the fourth quarter
this year to be from hybrids released in the past three years enabling a favorable mix
that cadence what also affects that ramp rate is the number of different services that we offer so right now we're offering about five to six unique types of services and we have programs in the pipeline that are coming so each one of those
oil is up a lot from where it was in the first quarter of 'sixteen and prices for most polymers have been moving up over the past year
we will also refer to non-gaap measures we request that you review the reconciliations to gaap statements provided with our earnings news release and today's slides which are posted on our website
i look forward to updating you on the progress we have made against this and all of our two thousand and seventeen priorities next quarter with that i'll turn the call back over to greg thanks jim
how you compare the strength of the environment -- what you're seeing in 'seventeen compared to what you expect for 'eighteen and 'nineteen based on what you will be launching and the expected ramp schedules
however that could be offset slightly by the fact that our royalty rate is going up as we ramp a larger presence in the roundup ready two xtend profile as well as intacta acres in latin america and
silver prices are also better in this case it is three percent up
currency prices coming from loans that we granted versus our loans in us dollars that's our normal level of debt so if
in q three you believe that sales should be more or less in line with the production or perhaps your sales will be higher than the actual production volume because you have
about the period definitely it will pick up speed in q three definitely because of -- well we're getting ready to
the news about the results of the company for the first six months and second quarter of the year we have a good performance and we're happy
as several of our international customers are having difficulty converting their local currency to us dollars leading to cash collections being delayed ralph will provide more color in his remarks
one with the national park service one with a large western us city and another from a major texas electrical utility this is just the tip of the iceberg
as certain customers have had difficulty obtaining us dollars to pay our invoices these late payments are timing issues and are not bad debt problems
we announced strategic partnerships with software vendors and a research institution to leverage sdn for the automation and advanced control of microwave networks
moving to working capital dsos were ninety nine days which was consistent with both our second and third quarters in fiscal 'sixteen dsos continue to be impacted by slower international customer payments as i just noted
our customers recognize this value as they assess their tco although we have improved our processes and become more efficient in supporting this market
looking into q one even though our international cash conversion cycle is stretched out we expect to be cash neutral or positive on an operating basis
and we consider our internal controls over financial reporting to be effective as of our fiscal twenty sixteen year-end
and we remain on track to bring aviat to profitability this fiscal year on an adjusted ebitda basis
and then make some comments regarding our balance sheet additionally you can view the reconciliation of gaap and non-gaap financial measures in our press release
we expect q one revenues to be flat to slightly up from q four with improvements expected in margins and spending we anticipate our losses will lessen significantly from the q four levels
is provided in the tables included with our press release and in our quarterly report on form ten-q filed this morning
our strongest overall results are being driven by sales to destination guests who were responsible for more than three quarters of our total growth and now represent approximately forty four percent of our total pass holders
while our first fiscal quarter continues to operate at a loss the addition of perisher has significantly improved the profitability of our business during this period when our us-based mountain resorts are not open for winter operations
here you can see the results of our strong underwriting discipline as there are only three loans delinquent greater than ninety days
except as required under applicable law during this call references will be made to non-gaap financial measures as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance
and six percent from the third quarter of twenty seventeen as we continue to focus on the origination of multifamily commercial real estate and commercial business loans with full banking relationship
these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared
since the third quarter of twenty seventeen the competition for deposits this quarter was especially strong in the municipal sector
regarding taxes the effective tax rate was just under ten percent for the third quarter benefiting from the release of a previously accrued tax liability
for over ten years and as a result we've got a track record there we brought new people along to help us grow the portfolio so we've got the ability to
of nineteen ninety five such statements are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such statements
overall we expect continued competition for deposits and additional compression on the net interest margin through twenty nineteen we are pleased with our ability to generate strong
i look forward to doing a deep dive on our plan and providing a q one and fiscal twenty seventeen outlook as well as discussing how our plan will translate into long-term financial performance
so your question is very relevant we will address it in detail on june seven but we have a clear path to how we're going to evolve the products and how we're going to connect that
that was essentially positioned more towards polo we've started to undertake conversion of some of those stores two stand-alone polo stores versus the hybrid
good morning and thank you for joining ralph lauren's fourth quarter and full year fiscal twenty sixteen conference call
our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our sec filings
at our investor day on june seven when we last spoke i shared with you how i spent my first three months in the role my initial observations and a rough outline of my approach to building the growth plan for this great company
today i will provide an overview of our main priorities and recent performance before turning the call over to bob to discuss the q four and fiscal year financial results in more detail
much more specific guidance at our investor day on june seven it's -- we think it's really important
as you saw in the press release net revenues were in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter down one percent on a reported basis and flat in constant currency
this is in line with the guidance we provided in february of a flat to two percent decline on a reported basis
this was largely due to the rapid acceptance of abbvie's hepatitis c therapy which works across multiple genes and does not require the same level of testing as previous therapies
so is that driven by acquisitions or do you think that organic growth will improve from the oh point five percent that you reported this quarter
i think you highlighted that the drug monitoring testing and the vitamin d should come back once you work with the payers
we achieved a number of important objectives over the last twelve months i would like to highlight two in particular
i didn't see anything mentioned on that in the ten-k that you filed this morning so could you just update me on what happened with that
which while impacting debt has not had a meaningful contribution to our ebitda starting in q one we will finally begin to recognize earnings for the new vessel
therefore adjusting for the impact of those discontinued products and looking at the four outlined in my previous comments related to our continuing core wheels business
to emphasize that we have completed this four-year transition of reducing volatility while increasing premium
now going into the financial year so i have just singled out three areas that were of concern or were happening last year
then looking back don't forget that two thousand and seventeen was not that an easy year from sentiment as well in europe when i come to the whole trading environment and there you have to see
but i think i would like to stress here as well the point that there are markets we entered only in the last three to four years that are still small but at that level we can grow nicely
it is not as if you have a permanent business then you can intervene three four weeks or six months or four months later when there is something not working
so when we look into 'eighteen we definitely will go back
so for that reason i think doing that and as well assuming that five percent i think we are on the safe side that we should be able to do that
when you're talking about seasonal business you make a change in christmas 'fifteen that change now
on their own eight hundred stores in brazil so we can as well bet on their health
so what does that mean for the shareholder i think it's again positive news over the last twenty -- last years we have been able to constantly
you may remember germany france italy and switzerland were the four core markets we started on
now it's not that this is finished but i think we still just have lower contribution now the second thing is that we as well these two companies
that was the markets in brief and quickly going through it i have two or three comments on switzerland and now allow me to go into that
but at the end you can say what is new that is basically what we have to deal with and had to deal with the last twenty years
we saw relatively high spot prices at the back end of twenty fifteen and i'm just trying to get a sense of whether we can still see some of the strength coming through in the current quarter
where the market is now is still above where it was a year ago so you are still going to see a growth in q three relative to what you saw last year
we were able to deliver record q four and full year adjusted ebitda we also demonstrated the ability to further expand margins
we are now nearing the completion of two new fluid power manufacturing plants constructed at existing gates locations
although we improved ebitda performance in two thousand and seventeen over the prior year we had higher capex associated with our growth investments and our sales growth had the impact of increasing working capital dollars even though it was at a lower rate than in prior years
we were also able to improve our adjusted ebitda margin and reduce our leverage while continuing to invest in the business
which we expect to come online in the second half of this year and ramp up into two thousand and nineteen we expect these investments to position us well for growth
resulting in core revenue growth of over nine percent for the fourth quarter and full year
and that we will be fully offset by the end of the first quarter of two thousand and eighteen we agree with most views that we are entering a more inflationary environment and remain committed to react with pricing where appropriate
most of my questions have been answered i guess just two follow-ups one can you just comment on the sort of order trends or what you've seen so far in the first quarter i would assume the demand trends continue to be strong and i don't know if they were trending above
and we continue to pursue a number of conversion opportunities examples of which include the personal mobility space industrial mro and mobile equipment applications
our adjusted ebitda margins does reflect the investments we have made in growth both on an inorganic and organic basis
thanks ivo i will now cover our q four financial performance beginning on slide nine where as ivo mentioned earlier you can see the record results that we have delivered for revenue and adjusted ebitda adding to our core growth
and given our greater than sixty percent replacement market focus and the strength of our brand we believe that we are well positioned in this regard
sort of your targeted five percent to six percent organic growth although it's early in the year i get that but any color there and then my second question any more color you can provide on
continue to target -- the general guidance i would give you is we would continue to target a a hundred percent conversion or better except for the higher amount of growth capital that we invest
a big piece of it and then the second piece of it is as we locked in our streaming contract for the next two years we were able to take advantage of our anticipated
i would say the year will end up north of eight thousand and you would have continuous growth but
our plan right now is to open the atlanta dc in the spring
of 'nineteen that is going to be a purchase that's the first one that we've had as we move forward with these other distribution centers we'll look at those on an individual basis
can you give us a sense for the timing of when we might see one oh twenty basis point impact on any of the margin line items
this class is entirely built of the refreshed concept so we saw an immediate tick up in 'seventeen with the refreshed concept
that's continued into 'eighteen you layer in what 'eighteen has over 'seventeen is the halo of the spinner
and are made pursuant to and within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of one thousand nine hundred ninety five as amended
and demonstrate our continued ability to generate solid cash flow and core eps looking across our business results for the first quarter we were pleased with the stabilization we saw in the business
definitions and reconciliations of differences between gaap and non-gaap financial measures are provided in appendix a of both the earnings release and the prepared remarks
this means that whilst all of gas distribution is deconsolidated from continuing operations in the current year we will report a thirty nine percent share of profits from the associates in continuing operations next year
the reduction on these projects was partially offset by an increase in non-load-related spend to meet riio outputs
before discussing our technical guidance i want you to take a -- take you through a more detailed look at this year's eps and how this sets up for next year
this is a quirk of accounting standards so for your benefit we've calculated a pro forma continuing eps for this year
our strategy is focused across three specific areas first we're finding new ways of optimizing our operational performance
but could you just give us an idea about the timing on when you need to submit your business plans when you might get an early indication of wacc from the regulator for instance
additional allowances contributed eighty basis points of performance in line with the prior year
on the customer growth side we have less than seventy percent gas penetration across our territories that means there are more than one million households that are still burning oil or another fuel creating opportunity for further investments
this concluded a long and complex process that involves separating gas distribution from the rest of our uk business agreeing with pension trustees to split the scheme into three sections and then a major financing program
as you know we completed the gas distribution sale on the thirty first of march the accounting for this large transaction has added a layer of complexity to the results for the year
we have provided alternative metrics which adjust for this as you can see these are broadly similar to the prior year and comfortably above the levels expected for the nine-months credit rating
we've used a variety of technological innovations such as a new type of switchgear and virtual modeling to reduce the total cost of this project by twenty percent in addition we continue to review opportunities to reduce our environmental impact
we realized this is a significant request so we provided two additional years of data to facilitate a multi-year settlement
the second quarter and the remainder of two thousand eighteen the first quarter was about as choppy as it gets for our business
our permian frac business seemed to encounter the bulk of the delays with several of our jobs pushing into late q one and into q two the permian basin has been a magnet
and so i can't help but think that the demand is building and that all of this is going to whipsaw at some point i don't know if it's q two q three or when and i don't know if
but as you look out into q two q three do you see an opportunity to take some net price here on top of whatever wage inflation you may experience
and -- for instance we had one customer that sold out in eastern new mexico and we were running five rigs a day
that is not to say that we haven't seen a decrease in the twenty four-hour packages
increased equipment activations in two thousand and eighteen will require the industry to look outside the current labor pool
adjusted ebitda for the first quarter was lower than what we originally expected while cash capital expenditures came in higher for the first quarter than we anticipated
we anticipate the full company revenue for q two is likely to be seven percent to eleven percent higher
that is included in our general and administrative expense this presentation of adjusted ebitda aligns us with many of our peers that add back
yes the duc count continues to climb and i'm just trying to sort through
when you look at the duc count and you looked at the rig count and you look at what's going on in the macro
these and other efforts culminated in several critical accomplishments over the past twelve months
both in the cpt code payment for the procedure and the drug
that we have to focus that the cpt code is paid so that they adopt so
furthermore many of our customers were primarily refractive lasik centers and have little or no experience with buy and bill drugs
can you give a little bit more color around what is different heading into twenty nineteen of course we have the j code but just a little more color about what gives you the confidence and the acceleration
and we're finding the opportunity to put our kxl systems and our drugs into those accounts so there are opportunities that are
is there a percentage of that three hundred system installed base that you guys are not really actively engaged in folks that maybe
for example we see through our arch program
compared to the adjusted ebit and caused particularly by lower interest costs
most of it came from a big contract in mexico this product -- project is now finished and fully included in the 'eighteen figures as
so we have several measures in place to make sure we maintain this level or can even decrease this level we have managed to get our personnel cost down two points
an extensive search and recruitment process was undertaken this morning we announced four new appointments
and it's nice when your efforts coincide with an increase in oil prices so that was very positive and our technical and operations groups are very keen that we can meet our flat production through fy 'twenty well on our way
but for the time being we're pretty confident that we'll move pending the ipt results
this is jeff nik i think it's probably going to be closer to fifty-fifty a lot of the increased production in the cooper basin jv is
produced the entire quarter and we saw an increase of six percent production over the previous quarter
and all of that hard work it was what i was trying to allude to in my prepared remarks had set us up in 'one nine and 'twenty and beyond to be more balanced
they are much more relevant to the community they're probably going to do thirty percent to fifty percent more in volume it's allowed us to really
at average spreads north of fifty percent as some of you have also noted in your research our track record of capitalizing on bankruptcies compares very favorably
it's important to note that the projects we are gearing up for redevelopment are creating over a a hundred basis point drag on occupancy
reflecting strong leasing productivity and redevelopment execution over the last twelve to eighteen months despite the headwinds experienced in the fourth quarter due to the rejection of six of our eleven sears kmart leases
turning to twenty nineteen as jim highlighted the coming year will be an opportunity for the investment community to see accelerating results from the work that has been done over the last three years to create a platform positioned to take full advantage of the opportunity embedded in this portfolio
so what we've been working on over the last two years what you've implicitly suggested has been setting up the ability to drive value in these kmart boxes and
putting us in a position where we have no debt maturities at this point until twenty twenty one expanding the flexibility of the balance sheet repaying all that secured debt has created a tremendous amount of operational and financial flexibility across the capital stack so we're really pleased
over the next six to eight quarters and so for us from an execution standpoint
and that rent is going to be commencing over the next six to eight quarters and it is a clear driver of what we see our noi growth to be for this year and next year
those were two names that we had been watching for a while there are still some uses and tenants out there that we're keeping a closer eye on but the magnitude of last year's bankruptcies are certainly smaller as we look into this year
also we will refer today to differ certain non-gaap financial measures further information regarding our use of these measures and reconciliations of these measures to our gaap results are available in the earnings release and supplemental disclosure
so can you talk about that decision and then maybe help us -- help quantify what sort of impact it's actually expected to have on your three percent same-store expectations for the year
and the impact that could have to us was not fully contemplated in the range and so i think what you really saw was a big impact in the fourth quarter like we talked about ninety basis points
by the end of two thousand and sixteen we expect our annual research and development spending on new products and cost reduction initiatives
that would tell us that we should be seeing increases through two thousand seventeen the other thing to remember is we do buy recycled material and recycled material
we have a number of open cases that are probably more than three years old where people have just not come back to complete the transaction necessary to do the repairs
the cash effect of this charge and the existing reserve will be incurred over the next fifteen-plus years
we will also run our plants at a higher capacity utilization to achieve the appropriate level of inventory to support two thousand seventeen growth objectives
if you go back over the last several years i think we've ranged primarily between the low forties and i think it's high as may be fifty percent okay
the company issued a press release yesterday after market closed containing financial results for the third quarter of twenty sixteen this release is available on the company's website
this relates to the surface flaking issue that affected a small portion of products produced at our nevada plant before two thousand seven to
during our distributor and sales meeting we shared one product in development with our sales and distribution team
we've been very effective at going to new vendors and being able to contain the cost increases on poly quite effectively over the last eight years
but certainly we want to be fair to both the company and the supplier the combination of those two certainly has had an impact
and in such anniversary year for the first time in our ninety two-year history we achieved both record revenues and operating profit
as for the reaction of the patients i have heard that according to various sns sources
please discuss how you are going to differentiate this product pfizer is conducting phase ii study in japan for an antibody product with similar mechanism
as one of the global programs domestic project was decided to be pursued between these two there is no contradiction
and make the payment of the remaining ninety percent and the deal is closed out
it be a possibility concerning fmi business
and on monday we issued a news release announcing approval recommendation granted by chmp in europe
whether the orders cover four months we do not have a clear picture of demand and supply currently so we are not able to report on anything binding yet
reporting our main focuses for our investment market mutual fund clients as of june our n-port n-cen solution within our arcfiling product was made available
and growth in our saas offerings was more than offset by lower mutual funds volume in us investment markets
including approximately eighty basis points of a negative impact related to the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard
we came to know the sdl management team quite well and are very pleased with how the transaction concluded
lower transactional volume in the international segment and lower compliance volume in us capital markets
in addition to continued secular declines and modest price reductions in prints there were a couple of projects in the second quarter of twenty seventeen that did not repeat this year
before i move on to our operating priorities i'd like to discuss the sale of our language solutions business which closed on july twenty two this transaction was an important step in executing our strategy
delivering on a culture of speed to execution innovation and agility i'm pleased to share we've recently brought on two new officers to our executive team
excluding the negative impact from the change in revenue recognition standard second quarter ebitda margin improvement of ninety basis points
aligning directly to our five-year plan and allowing us to better focus on our global regulatory and compliance offerings
as highlighted in this morning's press release we provided updated full year two thousand and eighteen guidance to reflect the impact of the disposition of the language solutions business
we will expect to maintain at least that level of growth through twenty seventeen but we will assess that when we get there
the company plans to replace its existing meters between twenty seventeen and twenty nineteen to provide expanded benefits to customers and to comply with state-mandated regulations on metering technology
it's designed to provide significant benefits for electricity consumers in the northeast ppl electric utilities has filed an interconnection request
along with our ability to earn incentive revenues are two very strong reasons
the increase for twenty fifteen is primarily driven by the lower depreciation expense from the asset life extension
in revenue through a rate increase to be effective january one twenty sixteen the settlement will help fund additional reliability improvements
on the susquehanna-roseland project we demonstrated our ability to cooperate with multiple state and regulatory government agencies and to partner with a neighboring utility which built an additional fifty miles of transmission line in new jersey as part of that project
shifting south to kentucky we retired the final two generating units at our green river station on september thirty this marks the completion of our plan to retire eight hundred megawatts of coal-fired generation in kentucky
that concludes my prepared remarks and i'll turn the call back over to bill thank you vince ppl continues to be a very compelling investment opportunity within our sector
earnings for that segment sort of being shifted a little bit into two thousand and seventeen and potentially earlier than that well two things one is we will continue to update on a quarterly basis where we stand relative to those incentive targets
and as i indicated earlier in my remarks we are now confident we can achieve six percent compound annual earnings growth
at which time we will target a four percent to six percent dividend growth rate more in line with our earnings growth expectations
turning to slide eleven the primary schemes that contribute to incentive revenues include the interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction
kind of current level of performance so if wpd is able to continue to improve that would push us
kentucky but your us utility growth rate puts you kind of well above the norm for traditional utilities can you talk about some of the other drivers of that besides those two items i referenced
moving to slide three you'll see our agenda for today's discussion we'll begin with an overview of our third quarter and year-to-date earnings results
before i jump into the earnings details however let me tell you briefly where we stand with three quarters of the year behind us
we currently expect to be in the targeted payout range by the end of twenty sixteen so our current expectation is that we will grow the dividend
the final rule was just published last friday october twenty three and the final impact of the rule will note not be known until the state implementation plan or the state's specific federal implementation plan has been developed
and we expect that to continue into riio-ed one our ability to execute on our plans and achieve incentive revenue has been key to our financial performance
while we have only been performing under riio for six months as i mentioned earlier the benefit of being fast-track afforded us the opportunity to begin to plan our approach to delivering outputs
on slide fifteen our pennsylvania regulated segment earnings for the third quarter were flat compared with a year ago
with the new disclosures and now six months behind us in terms of how well we feel about
in terms of the next end of the period i guess when would that be vince in terms of the measurements yes i mean it's the same schedule as the 'fifteen 'sixteen so
excluding the project revenues are projected to increase approximately fifteen percent slightly down from our previous projections due to some project slippage in the linings business
we currently expect the majority of this work to be completed in the second half with the potential for some work into early two thousand nineteen this project is a
we entered twenty nineteen with a very strong platform in place from a business development standpoint and we're seeing strong experienced leadership in place in each of our profit centers now a full marketing team in place for the first time in a year
and we review those every month in alco and then periodically look at how we can bring those more in line with our standard pricing over time
and the business development offices that we had in twenty seventeen and 'eighteen had become acclimated and more productive as they gain experience at first western
in the organization about enforcing minimums we've added some significant new services over the last three months that are going to drive higher margins
but our pipelines are up significantly like fifty percent if you do an apples-to-apples comparison on where we were
we're comfortable paying a higher rate to win the initial deposit relationship even if that results in short-term nim compression
our q two result showed a continuation of our solid business development
just to add one thing on your first question in terms of cost in the first half do remember what we spoke about in the q one where we said that we were making sure that it was not so backend loaded as it had been in previous years
a transcript of this conference call will be added to our website and the IR app within the next
we've seen one of the competitors effectively raise prices is it something that you are looking to do also to improve your arpu or
partner trading remained seasonally strong as we saw the benefits from the migration due to the four G focus we also saw strong demand on vdsl which more than offsets the adsl losses
we have seen that being in line with the expectations already throughout the year and also in the course of the q four we have not seen a major effect
as you can see from the regulatory effects that we have seen in q four you can see
we invite you to read the complete disclaimer included in the first page of this presentation which you will also find on our website in the ir section
on the revenue side we have already started a series of portfolio adjustments for the o two plan as well as in the blau area
and who are now gearing up to the same thing again for the next chapter of our journey our digital transformation over the next four years
growth plus required transformation investment the regulatory effects on oibda are slightly lower
on its operational and financial achievements of the last three integration years
revenue trends are solid as we are looking to grow in line with the german market commercial momentum and successful synergy delivery drove significant oibda growth
additionally today's remarks will include a discussion of certain financial measures that are not presented in conformity with us
we are now in the process of implementing changes that we think will drive higher connect continue to improve arpu and give our customers even greater choice and control
offering business customers the freedom and flexibility of the latest cloud-based virtual pbx technology
our third quarter is the first time that our quarterly results fully reflect combined legacy cable one and legacy newwave results for both 'seventeen and 'eighteen now getting into the 'eighteen third quarter results
we continue to experience steady and strong adjusted ebitda growth and margin expansion and feel good about our opportunity to extend that into the future
i am also excited that we can now discuss cable one's growth in total as both the current and prior year
once again our results demonstrate the successful execution of our long-term strategy which we believe serves both cable one customers and our shareholders well
the result is that at peak utilization we are only using twenty five percent of our available capacity which means that we are well positioned to not only add customers
and cable one is matching donations made by our associates to support some of those with the greatest need and now steven will provide more financial details on our third quarter results
one of our associates took first place in the challenge and six of the nine finalists came from cable one
to give you a magnitude of customers today we have a customer that has twenty two proprietary stores in addition to a franchise
you've been growing tef and i just want to get a better understanding about the customer profile that you are selling and sub-acquiring can you just give me
what i said makes sense for the next two years and along the same line i understand that you want to maintain more stable margins but
a better solution with a better fit depending on the scale of the project or maybe eventually your oms business today could probably
the levels of twenty eighteen should be the levels to be expected looking forward
an idea of the number of stores and the size and the magnitude of the sub-acquiree and what is the tef that you already
in a given year the recurring revenue will start to be generated as of next year and -- because it takes about at least six months
vehicle dealerships we have two products one was already operating in the cloud and the other one was not running in the cloud
all of these major projects of oms are now being delivered so how do you
i mean this would be eight percent growth if you consider the number of stores you mentioned and these are all
customers that are more traditional with clv i just want to understand the difference why
what is your outlook to grow recurring revenue in twenty nineteen do you anticipate some recovery what could we expect
larger projects as you said the revenue share is larger that's why there should be some room to grow further in the next two years
we launch our oms lite i don't know whether this will be the name
large deal we started working we put together a large deal team almost eighteen months ago now and for the first time in our company we started working with the advisers and the influencers community
duncan has made a substantial contribution to our company over the last nine years and i'd like to thank him for seeing the company through to year-end disclosures and we wish him every success with his new endeavors
now before i hand off to allan just a couple of specific items to note our ctr delivered a home initiative in ottowa is well underway and we're collaborating closely with our dealers
but we need to be more aggressive although i'm pleased with the performance in 'seventeen i think we could have set the bar higher and acquired more aggressively
mark's has a lot of potential and i think twenty eighteen will be an important year for mark's to begin to establish a relationship with a new generation of canadians
looking forward i see more opportunities to improve roic by further enhancing our approach to allocating capital among our businesses
caused the business mix of the retail segment to shift towards ctr and given its business model it has as you know the lowest margin rate of our three retail businesses
come down by thirty two basis points especially in a year when we were investing so heavily in the business to drive new capabilities like consumer brands digital store sport and analytics to mention a few
at the different banners and then how do you expect to be able to leverage that in your business in 'one eight and 'nineteen i mean is it a matter of
so you can expect to see us adopt the same type of approach at fgl that you would have seen
frankly a great year but not an end state as we still have our sights on continued improvement with a new leg of operational efficiency programs targeting some key areas like it and supply chain
the departments together and then blend them together and not have two people doing the same job and a certain task being done two or three times so that certainly has to continue and i don't think anybody would say that the
in twenty eighteen all the banners will continue to collaborate to improve all aspects of our operations moving from a banner view of operating effectiveness to a one company framework where the benefits will be larger and accrue faster
that are nontraditional and that can make money in those categories so i'd say for the last eighteen months or so
area that they would have picked up say in the last six or nine months to be in charge of all
information regarding these factors is contained in yesterday's press release and with the company's other filings with the sec
administration services only or aso contract with the state of new york at the beginning of the second quarter
on our transportation network our efforts to improve our network capacity and efficiency are beginning to pay off with financial benefits and improved service levels so to summarize we have twenty work streams in progress
remember that aso contracts tend to be higher margin as transportation costs are paid directly by the client and do not essentially flow through our revenue line as is the case for our other contracts
now moving to our balance sheet summary on page nine you can see that our cash balance fell from last quarter due to the temporary working capital movement i just discussed which reversed itself in july
the company will also discuss non-gaap financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors
and i'm pushing my luck here but would you give us a peak sales estimate for your two new drugs that you have in-licensed
in discussing our first quarter twenty seventeen i will focus on the main aspects that have impacted our results and i will make reference to the earnings call presentation
on slide twelve we show the overall allowances covering our book with a more moderate increase in coverage levels the walk of loan allowances from stages one to three for the quarter illustrates
let me move on to margins so from funding to margins we have been able to maintain the net interest margin over twenty percent for the quarter
on page fifteen we recapped return on average equity and capitalization trends
the stage three pressure is going to diminish over the course of the next few quarters and depending on asset growth
these are defined by the private securities litigation reform act of one thousand nine hundred and ninety five they are based on information and data that is currently available however the actual performance may differ due to various factors
so move on -- moving on to credit quality i'm glad to report that we have made important progress to resolve two of the problematic loans we had in our portfolio
first of all from a comparison side twenty seventeen will have one big quarter and the rest mostly flat i think twenty eighteen will be much more calibrated throughout the year
we anticipate strong results in the fourth quarter based on the positive response from our global preview of lumispa at live
we anticipate the initial rollout of these -- of the program to begin in the pacific markets later this year and then globally over the next two years
perhaps i was being too bullish about the fourth quarter at least with regard to FX i thought it would be probably more neutral and it sounds like there will still be some
i think if you look at us over the last about ten years we've averaged about two percent net reduction in outstanding shares every year
a strong increase in international sales and a modest increase in commercial sales during the quarter were more than offset by lower than anticipated us consumer sales
which occurred when orders that were anticipated to ship in the third quarter of two thousand seventeen did not ship until early in the fourth quarter we do not believe this change will result in a shortfall in the back half of the year
cash flow before financing activities is expected to be positive this year but lower than twenty sixteen over the past several years the pace of new kitchen collection store openings has slowed and the number of store closings has increased
net income in two thousand eighteen is expected to increase modestly compared with this year as the benefit of the increase in revenues are expected to be mostly offset by the cost to implement these initiatives and the incremental public company costs
following his remarks i will provide an overview of the financial highlights for the third quarter of twenty seventeen before we open the call for questions
and hope that such a meeting can occur early in twenty eighteen ideally in the january time frame
this is perhaps an obvious statement to make after receiving two complete response letters but it is important to keep in mind as we are moving ocular forward to be able to support not only dextenza manufacture
based on the feedback we receive at that fda meeting as well as data from additional manufacturing runs
and it's possible that we would continue development there but i personally won't speak to the timing of that but we have one successful
and while dextenza is the most near term and immediate imperative it's no more important or urgent than development of our pipeline the hydrogel platform has a multitude of current and potential applications that we intend to bring forward either by ourselves or in partnership with other companies
in addition while not a primary endpoint the iop reduction will also need to be clinically meaningful for regulatory approval
debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of twenty eighteen this is of course subject to a number of assumptions about our clinical development programs and other aspects of our business
of twenty eighteen we're working with a strong sense of urgency and the need for speed but we also recognize how critical it is
to enhance operations and reduce expenses surrounding the delayed dextenza launch
the number of common shares to be issued at the end of every six-month interest period
the complexity associated with the development of five g and its prototypes
one example of the efficiency from sitewide software adoption comes from abb a global leader in power and automation technologies
finally i would like to mention that i will be at the oppenheimer industrial conference in new york on may eleven the stephens roadshow on may twelve in boston
this weakness resulted in a lower performance in q one than we had expected and adversely impacted our rf product sales
we are in a position to lead the research and elemental technology using noma and high frequency
we believe we are in a unique position driven by having the largest pxi product portfolio in the industry a differentiated software position for creating modular systems
in q one we continued to be impacted by the challenging economic environment resulting in revenue performance below our expectations
rather than driving around with the infotainment system installed in a vehicle the engineering team used ni products to produce and measure signals in a lab to quickly test a wide range of scenarios
this sentiment has been validated at recent events like mobile world congress in barcelona and the five g summit in brooklyn where ni customers like nokia and intel have demonstrated the power of our modular approach
at the embedded world technical conference in nuremberg we highlighted how the ni platform is ideally suited to take advantage of ubiquitous connectivity and edge analytics that are needed for the industrial internet of things
in summary we felt the impacts of a challenging economic environment in q one and still managed to deliver positive core revenue growth
throughout our history our company and platform has weathered many economic and currency cycles while remaining committed to our a hundred-year plan
beginning in emea we had strong wins across the region and while the middle east is experiencing a slowdown we delivered profitability in line with our expectations
we anticipate our third quarter eps will be similar to the first quarter due mostly to the ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market and our anticipated aecom capital realization in the fourth quarter
there's more of that to come there's some big big consolidations we just did a big one in denver which is one of our largest offices that are now operating about fourteen hundred people in one location
thank you operator before reviewing our results i'd like to direct you to the safe harbor statement on page two of today's presentation
i will begin with an overview of aecom's results and discuss the trends across our diverse business then troy will review our financial performance in greater detail steve will conclude with financial guidance before turning the call over for a question-and-answer session
our backlog increased by eight percent in the second quarter and with the anticipated benefits from the federal transportation bill and growing spending in canada we are confident growth will continue to improve
thanks troy please turn to slide thirteen we are pleased with the progress of our business particularly the swing to organic growth in the americas dcs business
this compares to only ten percent in two thousand thirteen and is a testament to our ability to expand strong businesses into new markets and geographies let's move to our energy and industrial construction business
the strong margin improvement in overall dcs and in ms and the enhanced pipeline of opportunities across our diverse end markets
competitive environment when your -- for these projects is a lot more fierce relative to say twelve months ago because when i think about you winning all these work in management services and what your margins have been in management services that has pretty
we've got execution to do on the real estate and we have a track record of executing quite well we've taken out two hundred and five locations and consolidated them
the federal transportation bill the first time in ten years that we've had a long-term bill and then the private sector that is
in addition more than twenty five states and metros have enacted new infrastructure funding measures over the past three years
thanks mike please turn to slide six our second quarter results were consistent with our expectations with the exception of our oil and gas business where market conditions remain challenging
key things that need to happen in the next two quarters of 'sixteen to keep you on track for your 'seventeen plan
ms we have very significant margins in that sector but our second half will probably exceed our expectations relative to what we
to get our people together we've removed three million square feet of space and brought our people together
the program is expected to be executed through two thousand nineteen but is not specific as to when or how many shares will be purchased
i would say historically strategic accounts do best in the second half of the year and in particular in the fourth quarter and that was true again in twenty seventeen so this is a little bit consistent
in large part because of the opportunity to attach content to their learning deals which results in a much larger asp and a much bigger opportunity for them especially given the new commission rates
but content is not our only opportunity to drive more recurring revenue in addition to our core solutions and the continued upside opportunity around our recruiting and hr suites
we continue to see strong momentum from our european business with q four closing the largest number of new client wins in the region's history
we are pleased with the performance we saw in the second half of the year and believe the changes we made will drive strong momentum through twenty eighteen another strong performer for the year was client sales
subscription revenue begins the day we sign a contract and is recognized ratably over the lifetime of that contract arr shows the annual recurring revenue at a particular point in time
for two thousand eighteen we expect that our capital expenditures will increase to three percent to four percent of revenue as we continue to make improvements to our data infrastructure to support our client growth
the census bureau and the sec and we see opportunity more broadly
i'd like to start by updating you on the latest developments of the strategic plan that we first introduced on the q three earnings call
which will be a significant driver of margin improvement for twenty eighteen we also have optimized our annual budget to drive significant margin improvement
we believe organizations spend anywhere from two to five times more on learning content than they spend on their learning management system
with that i'd like to turn it over to brian to discuss our twenty seventeen fourth quarter and full year financial performance as well as our twenty eighteen outlook in more detail
as of december thirty one since our business is very seasonal and we tend to capture a lot of arr in the back half of the year this metric is best reviewed on an annual basis
this amount also includes the funding of two new european data centers in paris and frankfurt
and we now have a new opportunity both with cornerstone hr and with content
the truth is we probably should have been doing this on a recurring basis five or ten years ago but we absolutely can do it now and that creates an incremental recurring revenue stream for us and one that's
the us enterprise business has always been a rock for us the exception was the first half
there are four aspects that make the training content market interesting for cornerstone
what makes us even more compelling is the fact that the learning management system budget and the content budget generally come from two different sources
on january two we appointed jeff lautenbach to the position of president of global field operations
this was driven by the continued adoption of the cornerstone hr suite as well as accelerating traction with cornerstone recruiting
it's worth noting that this annual dollar retention on a net basis continues to exceed one hundred percent demonstrating that we have
i want to especially thank our global team for all of their great work during this transition to help more than thirty five million people around the world to realize their potential
of twenty seventeen we can talk about that later but we clearly had an issue there in the first half of 'seventeen it recovered in the second half of twenty seventeen and we expect that will continue to be a big portion of our business
before we begin our presentation i encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on slides two and three in the investor presentation on our website which explain the risks of forward-looking statements
for such measures reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measures are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation i will now turn the call over to curt morgan to kick off our discussion
which are set forth on slide six it is worth mentioning again that we increased our guidance for both companies in may when we initiated guidance for the combined company
now you might be wondering why we are not updating our twenty eighteen ongoing operations guidance ranges given the year-to-date performance that has exceeded expectations embedded in the may guidance
and as a result we believe over time this unique financial characteristic will lead to a full valuation for vistra it takes very low maintenance capital to support the ebitda of the company given the combination of highly efficient low-cost in-the-money fleet
specifically july twenty eighteen wind production at the peak hour was right around the average wind production at the peak hour over the last three years in july
so again if you ask me what i would like to see i'd rather see the forward curves come up and reflect reality in 'one nine and 'twenty and take the risk
and then just one last quick one on the -- just your quick take on the ferc order on subsidized generation and capacity and
it's a 'nineteen issue i think it's a good issue to have we can manage it and we could actually push more into 'twenty if we wanted to
to see if there's any type of irrational build but i think it's a combination of those two factors
the combined company -- the sum of the two revolvers for the -- that we had before that were a little bit less than that
the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-gaap financial measures
in the end as we execute as expected in twenty eighteen and twenty nineteen we can move on a number of capital allocation fronts
given the tight reserve margins we expect through at least summer twenty twenty we believe this backwardation will reverse at some point in the future
the ebitda what you would call -- you could say that the drag is what the savings is so we're not going to get the drag
i don't believe that you'll get through a straight mopr-ex with complete exemptions that shuts out the states
also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation our ten-q and the related earnings release
we also have the commercial prowess and market liquidity to capitalize on volatility and lock in value on a two- to three-year forward basis contributing to certainty stability and visibility of our ebitda and free cash flow
and have direct discussions but that's probably later this year early 'nineteen before we engage in that
you guys know this i mean the ercot weather can change on a dime and so we want to -- i think it's prudent for us not to do anything yet on full year guidance and we'll have a lot to talk about at the q three call around that
in ercot again so i think it's going to be developers and then it's very very difficult -- i know this when i was at ecp it's extremely difficult to get financing
if you multiply relative to the estimated 'nineteen realized price doesn't seem like too much of a change but can you elaborate a little bit on some of the puts and takes going on there might it be slightly lower across all the regions
from ebitda is that a kind of -- do you look at that as a fixed number going forward or is that something that trends in an upward direction over time i'm just curious
some of its august twenty eighteen and summer twenty nineteen length in the spring when the forward curve ran up and was higher than our fundamental point of view
we believe it is prudent at this point to reaffirm our guidance and wait until our third quarter call to consider an update to both the twenty eighteen and twenty nineteen guidance ranges however we feel very good about where we are at this point in time
of twenty eighteen to prove this out so please stay tuned for further updates on this topic
but we do think there's a couple of ideas that we're going to go forward with we're trying to work as i said with a number of different parties to try to get people to sign off i think it's -- strength is in numbers when you go to ferc and we think we're trying to -- or i think we may have a coalition
because i do believe ferc believes that part of their role is to try to work with states and some of the things that states are trying to accomplish
constant over time or is that something that trends in one direction or another yes i think it generally is on average sixty percent over time
longer term we believe that the favorable impact from our strategic programs will return growth to cdi with multi-year growth averaging high single digits
with fourteen of those quarters being positive silvercrest's growth has been achieved while we have maintained or increased our adjusted ebitda margins even as we've invested in the business on behalf of our clients and for future growth
so those additional hires have been made and they haven't as you've noticed affected our comp ratio or hit ebitda because it was done within our current growth scenario
we also hired a gentleman who was with graystone consulting and acted as a very high level pm
and so for that reason what we're doing here is paying both the dividend and doing acquisitions and that's still within well within the limits for what we can do on our net debt-to-ebitda target levels
so in fact when we look at the total impact in q one i would not be too focused on the component of that in the first quarter what i reassure is that we are seeing the savings coming through
are subject to future risks and uncertainties please refer to slide two of today's presentation for further details
over time we expect to increase the level of funding to two percent in addition to establishing processes to increase the cadence of successful new product launches
increased organizational focus on customers is driving growth as each luxfer salesperson is expected to reach out to at least two new customers every week
first quarter adjusted ebitda for gas cylinders up thirteen percent reflects the positive impact of the higher volume and pricing as well as productivity which was a direct result of manufacturing improvement
with existing products and as you know we also have new products which are likely going to help us kick start growth later in twenty nineteen and 'twenty so both the short term and long term are turning more positive there
any references to non-gaap financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation
in november we followed up with additional positive data from the duet trial which was presented in the late-breaking oral session
further analysis of the safety database from the initial eight-week double-blind treatment period presented at the conference showed that sparsentan was generally safe and well tolerated
as many of you know this definition was derived in conjunction with the neptune consortium
to complete the analysis and gain agreement with fda on this particular piece we are confident we will get there in the very near future
of fsgs stakeholders to efficiently enroll this trial far more  we have identified more than one hundred sites globally with interest in participating in the trial
but they also felt that they would like to see a longer observation period than the eight weeks
so heading into our end of phase ii meeting with the agency in late january
we estimate these sites represent more than sixteen hundred patients who would be potentially eligible
we had growth across all of our commercial products during the quarter which led to the twenty three percent growth over the fourth quarter last year
which was a controlled observation period in duet that was clear one of the things we are working with them on right now is what is the exact observation period that we want to put into the confirmatory trial
for entry into the trial beyond that we will continue to work closely with the neptune consortium and nephcure international organizations
finally i'll touch on our business development efforts before turning it over to laura to run through the financials BD remains a key piece of our strategy
we made substantial progress on both the development and commercial fronts in two thousand sixteen i'm very proud of our many accomplishments during the year most recently in the fourth quarter we presented additional positive data
it is worth noting that since the duet results were originally announced and presented last fall external awareness and excitement around the sparsentan program has grown significantly and the investigator patient and advocacy communities
as you know our cmo had an unforeseen manufacturing delay which resulted in us having to move first patient dosed in the trial
looking ahead to twenty seventeen we have a number of exciting initiatives that we expect to further our top line growth over twenty sixteen most notably we're implementing a small expansion of our sales force which will allow us to have two dedicated teams
based on our planned efforts we expect the use of the panel to double in twenty seventeen for zellweger spectrum disorders we will be pushing forward our patient identification efforts
the other thing they have asked us to do and which duet did not do for us
as well as the introduction of guidewire we're also looking to expand our market footprint in home staying firmly in the over-fifties camp and using the strong panel to help us to grow
and one final point is i am still going to be here for six months so these lot will still have to put up with me for that long and during this period i'm fully committed to driving the business forwards
earlier on i focused on the company's performance since ipo and especially on last year now let's look ahead the time is now right to invest in growing our customer base
why now firstly we've replaced the majority of our it systems
we now have over half million members over eighty percent of the customers that we talk to who have chosen to activate their membership and a high proportion of those then start to interact with the brand
and the positive experience that we've had in both large and small pi and finally the travel division increased profits materially
and while cruise will have more operational days in the current twenty nineteen financial year
we do not expect the group's overall leverage ratio to go above three times and
and there are early signs of success from our investment in motor and home broking we are delivering new customers let's be clear it's only two months in
so it gives us certainty over -- at all times over a three-year period and if there is a termination then we've got three years to find somebody to replace them
in our knowledge and our understanding of the over fifties in the longer term we expect to see a positive impact on churn rates
previous question i just answered just kind of come to bear and has been for the last twelve to eighteen months so the pricing on acquisitions wasn't making sense and then getting new product in markets where we didn't have existing product is
we opened up three new properties in london in the back half
we will walk -- we'll talk further about the terms of this credit agreement in a few moments lastly we're excited to announce that we finally finalized the amendments to the bvi water purchase agreement
these acquisitions bring quench's installed rental unit base to over ninety six thousand units as of august two and we continue to work on our robust pipeline of acquisitions with potential to close later this year
is excluded from revenue and adjusted ebitda if the contract was structured similar to our other water purchase agreements the cash collected would accrue revenue
thanks lee we are pleased with our organic performance to date having achieved strong adjusted ebitda results through the first half of the year
we will then walk you through our financial results in more detail and finally i'll return to provide color on our market outlook for the remainder of two thousand seventeen before opening the line for your questions
turning to seven seas water on slide six we had a very productive quarter with plants operating as expected all plants either met or exceeded production expectations and the majority experienced increased demand from our customers
and an increase at our trinidad plant due to an increase in volume of water delivered to our customer resulting from the plant expansion completed in two thousand sixteen the increases were partially offset by lower revenues at our bvi operation
the revised range for the combination of our adjusted ebitda plus the cash on the design and construction contract
so then the rest of the adjustment -- if you look at the rest of the adjustment for the second half of 'seventeen in our forecast
and so we'll get a little bit of helping wind from those two smaller acquisitions
could be exposed to competition from ace nine ten this should be expected to happen gradual as the penetration and approval around the world will be gradual
reversal of rebate in first quarter of 'sixteen when you look at the norditropin numbers but even with that the second quarter this year
the increase in cost reflects higher development costs driven by the pioneer program for semaglutide this is partly countered by lower costs following the completion of the devote trial
and a negative currency impact of four percentage points is now expected
two questions  if i can firstly can you explain some of the current dynamics you're seeing in medicare part d
it is pretty much in line with the approximately fifty basis point lower which is a kind of a net effect of the price impact
the outlook for operating profit reflects an expected increase in sales and distribution costs in the second half of two thousand seventeen compared to the first half
net of revenues from reimbursables in twenty seventeen principal factors were additional aircraft operations for amazon
we look forward to improved operating and financial performance for all of our businesses in twenty nineteen as they deliver even better service to their customers
okay so you're committed to the twenty even if amazon may not want seventeen more
largely due to the ten additional aircraft we leased and improved results from our airlines
these non-gaap measures are not meant to be a substitute for our gaap financials and we advise you to refer to the reconciliations to gaap measures which are included in our earnings release and on our website
plus higher interest and depreciation expense and lower maintenance revenues offset earnings gains from the ten freighters added to the fleet during the year
yes we're just trying to figure out if four q was just seasonally strong or if there was an impact of omni that's going to take the margins permanently higher in that segment
okay so amazon has flexibility and you also have flexibility with the twenty purchased from american is that the best way to look at it yes that's a fair statement
any such future warrants after march would be priced at a thirty-trading-day average price based on the date of contractual commitment for leases
a lot of runway there for them to be able to exercise calling the options on the seventeen to get the additional warrants so there's really no definitive time frame on that
before we begin i want to direct your attention to slide three which discusses our use of forward-looking statement
with this added cash we are now appropriately resourced to execute on our agreed regulatory requirements and to invest in launch preparation and commercialization to be successful in the competitive hae market
whereby an oral prophylactic is the patient and physician's overwhelming choice for living a normal life with hae disease
yes i would add liisa that at the boston college allergy college meeting there was a poster from the compact study that
entry criteria which opens up another sizable portion of the population of hae patients
the market is large and growing seventy three fifty three has the profile patients and doctors have been waiting for and the plan to get to approval is clear and it's now time to execute we look forward to updating you as we execute our plan
from our cash and investment balance at the end of fiscal twenty sixteen our twenty seventeen public offering resulted in the substantial strengthening of our financial position
all patients have completed the twenty four weeks and we've said that we expect that data in the first half of twenty nineteen that hasn't changed
and the second for the treatment of rosacea aptar's ophthalmic squeeze dispenser is also found on two new eye care products in latin america
we're serving eight different markets with a broad portfolio of dispensing and sealing solutions across many different geographies our level of project dialogue with our customers across each segment
until recently how much that was going to -- how much spend that was going to be before the end of the year then secondly it really reflects our cautious guidance in the q three so i mean as we've done in the past we've been pretty good stewards of capital when we see business
the facility is in france there are three -- in the site there are three production units one of which is the one where the fire significantly destroyed
and reported growth also reflects a negative translation impact of two percent coming from changes in foreign currency exchange rates
mega airless represented approximately nine percent of the sales growth in the beauty market
looking at each market on a constant currency basis sales to the food market increased six percent on increased sales to the dairy creamer sour cream and infant formula categories
i think we've done an excellent job as a company taking a look at our cost controls over the last and this is across all three segments
on july one two thousand and seventeen the closing of the sale will occur shortly after the proceeds of the television spectrum auction are distributed by the fcc which we expect to occur during our second fiscal quarter
and as anticipated some of this strength will be due to portions of work advancing into q three from q four with customers trying to get ahead of inflationary prices
and then as i have shared we see that there's an eighteen-month horizon where we are very strongly focused on our internal initiatives and the impact those are going to have
and there is -- are food fda regulations out there that are starting to come into play that people have to -- are getting to the end of the life cycle where they have to comply with but then you also have the local fresh food phenomenon
in the second quarter the nci team maintained a strong focus on managing costs driving operating efficiency and ensuring commercial discipline
and the board and the entire nci team are excited about the potential this project holds for us
we continue to expect our combined buildings and components businesses to track in the range of two percent to four percent volume growth
these metrics are not meant to replace gaap measurements but are provided as supplements to assist the public in their analysis and valuation of our company
we also closed the previously announced acquisition of three stations in the fairbanks alaska market
this approach has paid dividends many times over as lawmakers understand that they can speak directly with their local constituents by talking with our reporters right there in washington dc
the bureau provided nearly one hundred local interviews with house and senate lawmakers delivering our viewers both previews and reactions to the president's first joint address to congress
we also saw and you're seeing in q one so far what i would describe as a couple of key accounts that are reducing spending or changing spending habits a little bit which are driving our outlook for the quarter
stream cbs content even if it's not local or am i totally cut off from that
a bunch of deals that repriced on january one we have -- we don't believe in set deadlines and we will continue to grant extensions if we think the conversations are going in the right way
we're not in the room with them now so we can only assume as affiliates that the ott providers that really want something and have not been able to get it from the networks
and these stations already are integrating nicely with our anchorage television station ktuu which is the dominant television provider for nearly the entire state of alaska
for some other reasons mainly that i was doing them we got -- we just pushed a lot harder so i think looking into 'eighteen you should certainly assume that
but there's nothing that is going to be announced in the next two weeks that's for sure
that i can think of really besides maybe madonna who hasn't already passed away and it's sad commentary i don't mean to be cryptic here but there just aren't that many celebrities from the eighties who were celebrities throughout the nineties throughout the two thousands still around
joined a small group of fifteen other local television reporters for a private dinner at the white house with president trump and his chief of staff and his press team ahead of his speech to congress
turning to the guidance for q one and my comments are on a combined historical basis that will incorporate green bay davenport and fairbanks as if we had
on q one just wondering if you have a pace number and what your thoughts are on core and local and national for the year
folks who are reported to be interested in or have launched their mobile or their virtual mvpd product directly i know networks that are also talking with those folks
providers that are coming up that we could see kind of a pattern to what we saw this year or some -- as you just said some of those might get extended past january one and retroactive so it might not be even keel once we start the year
by december thirty one we tend not to start all that early we'd rather have more people go out before us than
but we're working on it is there a mechanism that you can see where youtube or any other of the ott players can apply pressure to the networks to make them do
between our largest market which under the current dma is knoxville and a lot of markets that are a lot larger than what we currently are
closed them on january first there's a couple of main drivers in the guidance first of all we've made some comments during the quarter that january got off to a slow start
single ott platform with every single one of our channels because we are not prepared to be giving our signals away or subsidizing
prices are always going to be retroactive to january one just out of the fact that there are so few people here at gray
and we again are just -- we've got basically two people at the company negotiating most of these big deals and have a lot of other things to do at year-end and beginning of the year
we have had a dedicated internal team complemented by external advisors working on a comprehensive approach for the past five months
and present our gaap financials in a matter that closely reflects our actual operations and cash flow chris will provide more details on this
as a reminder we use two non-gaap measures to supplement our gaap results and to provide a better view of our operations
these two measures are primarily how we internally measure our financial performance
it comes in the form of technology overlays that are able to complement the core ehr system and then infrastructure
and as a result of these efforts we are excited to launch the new brand in january of twenty seventeen the second part of our relaunch effort is relisting on one of the major exchanges
the first measure we use is gross cash generated from customer contracting activities which is our reported gaap revenue plus the change in deferred customer billing
and we believe it's important for investors to look at our results on this non-gaap basis as well the reason we use these non-gaap measures is gaap revenue recognition for a customer contract
over q three of two thousand and fifteen we continue to expect strong growth in this business over the next twelve months from an increase in volume driven by industry demand and market share gains
in closing i'd like to reiterate the high degree of confidence and visibility we have in the business as we look out over the next four to five years
chris will cover the financials in more detail in a few minutes but i'm pleased to say we are on track to deliver the top line guidance we have provided for twenty sixteen and are making progress towards sustained profitability
this renewal demonstrates the important role that accretive plays to provide focused and comprehensive rcm solutions
we highlighted on our last call the three engagement models with which we go-to-market these engagement models provide customers a flexible approach to create the required commercial infrastructure they will need to manage their revenue
for providers this means a higher revenue yield at a lower cost and improved days in ar
to put this in perspective from an employee headcount standpoint we will have increased the size of the company by fifty percent as we exit the year
before i turn the call over to chris let me touch a little on our pas model which continues to see strong growth
and the renewal of our agreement with intermountain which resulted in a catch-up contribution in q three before i walk you through the details of the results i would like to remind you that we will be referencing non-gaap numbers
meanwhile our large store in heathrow terminal three is currently being redeveloped and will open in the next few weeks
our aim is to target these stations as the opportunities arise to build a meaningful network of this new format and we'd expect to open around fifty of these over the course of time
and a challenging books market for us this christmas with no big genre to match the humor book titles or adult coloring books of the previous two years
and as you can see on the screen there's a picture there of what this looks like in the post office in leeds now this agency agreement will run for five years
and it will be hotly followed by work on an extended large store in heathrow terminal four we believe this new format will continue to present new opportunities
in addition we will continue to invest in new stores across all of our channels in uk and we expect to open between fifteen and twenty new stores in the current financial year
we've won seven units in total and we expect them all to open later this year
our strategy of effectively managing our space and assets continues to produce strong cash generation and sustainable profits gross margin was well-managed up eighty basis points in the half
and as i keep saying it is impossible to predict how many tenders will come onto the market each year but we expect to continue winning between twenty and thirty units in an average year well into the long term
now as usual we'll update you on our three-year guidance when we present to you in october so let's move on to category performance and i'll start with books
the group produced a good performance in the six months period to the end of february
and we'll continue to use the three economic models all whilst selecting the one that gives us the best outcome for a particular territory or a format
the one thing we do have the ability to do is typically get about a ninety-day lock and so right now we're again buying smartly and locking for those ninety days when we have the ability to see a
risks and uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual financial and operating results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings made with the sec
personnel that we have in vegas the long-term relationship that they have in that market and their ability to source great land opportunities and as you know they've grown their market share consistently over the last four years so
banning as well and as i said earlier the big news is down at pacific highlands ranch we're moving into our more westerly planning areas and we're going to have five new product offerings coming later this year
similar to the last quarter the zero to fifteen-day booking window remains weak with lower fares compared to the same period last year this has been further accentuated by the significant increase in capacity in the market
but in the interim we continue to add a lot of international markets that are within range of a three twenty family airplanes
one of the decisions considered in the top four or five cities and how much important is the international expansion with -- in this decision
as we touched on at the end of q one we are pleased to have been awarded a contract in canada's arctic regions
and several smaller residential projects twenty sixteen revenues were associated with a few small residential projects generated by the acquisition
our outlook related to modular solutions business remains very positive i appreciate the first half of two thousand seventeen has been a challenging period for stakeholders we are very optimistic about the next twelve months
as well certain financial measures discussed today are not recognized measures under generally accepted accounting principles or ifrs and more importantly more information regarding these measures can be found in our public documents
resulting in our second half industrial operations likely remaining similar to that of the first half of two thousand and seventeen a strong first nations partnering strategy has been the foundation of our company since inception
the cautionary statements contained in yesterday's news release and in our annual filings again both available on our website and on sedar outline various risk factors assumptions and cautions regarding forward-looking statements or information
and i'll come back with the outlook for the rest of two thousand and seventeen scott thanks rob i'll walk through our results for the second quarter in aggregate and then briefly comment on each of our major business lines
these have been unfortunate delays but we look at these as modest deferral in terms of timing for many of these projects out of our q two and to the back half of this year
i'll compare mainly to q two of twenty sixteen but will provide a few comments relative to our views for the rest of this year and going forward as well
which we actually launched in spring 'eighteen and that produced really seven key areas for the business to focus on and drive the business forward for growth
but the benefit also is we take a photograph in your home so we can ensure whether the van has taken away all the packaging that we've delivered the care kit if you've ordered a care kit as well as the furniture and that it looks great in your room and it's in a one condition
say we've now got the new hr person we've got john from a commercial point of view who replaced our previous
there's really two benefits the first one is we don't have that whole logistical and lack of and focus taken away from what we do
and they created actually two or three of those and they have tested which one is going to be the best they've looked at other areas on the old site so that when they build the new site it will actually be incorporated into the new site
as chris said it's five years ago that we really put our best foot forward in flooring it was time to do review of this area
ultimately there will be a final solution to the zika situation nationwide and there will be a meaningful upside to our operations regarding supply after a couple of years of outsized growth we now know there's only one smaller hotel reopening in south beach
we expect this growth to continue into q two and then perform in the low single digits for the balance of the year
while the supply of new hotels is increasing downtown we expect the demand growth will continue that said in q one we did underperform our expectations
situation with a big impact in 'seventeen behind us we have a couple of other things that i can't disclose going on in the portfolio that are positive
we -- with the disclosure of the north and south meeting halls we will undertake the renovation of our jw marriott
while the hotel is in great shape the real issues continues to be the impact of zika and the absorption of the new beach supply that has entered the market over the last twenty four months
accordingly q four will be the strongest quarter of the year for us with no property renovation disruption
i think we've done the right thing to get us through 'seventeen i am
we would like to remind you that webcast participants can beforehand pose their questions that are to be answered in the qa session
on slide seven we talk a bit about the company's financial performance
my next question is when you look at your last couple of acquisitions like moy park and the cargill pork acquisition can you just isolating those two can you talk about
do you feel like this is peak leverage for the company at the current time and what type of leverage target would you have for twenty seventeen given the earnings outlook
there should have been less variability in margins meaning this twenty one percent margin a year ago going down to seven percent seemed quite of a wide drop and once again having some pricing power and good brands
thank you todd our first quarter results are a reflection of and are consistent with the strong start to the year in all three of our primary markets
also our internal checks industry reports and dealer surveys continue to indicate that rv dealer inventory levels are in line with anticipated retail demand
which ramps up in the late first quarter and second quarter and statistics in twenty seventeen are very consistent with those levels in twenty sixteen with the expected retail demand levels
approximately fifty four percent of our industrial revenue base was directly tied to the residential housing market
initiate and gain traction on to be able to continue to penetrate that space so we're very optimistic about what we see on the mh side of the business as it relates to acquisition opportunities those are still in
in addition to our ongoing efforts thus far in twenty seventeen to strategically invest in capacity talent engagement and retention and certain overhead to support the growing demand and expectations in all three primary markets we serve
and the momentum continues to be very strong as rv manufacturers and dealers add capacity where necessary to meet growing demand
with growth rates and seasonality consistent with recent years our objective is to continue to outperform the mh market by capitalizing on our breadth of product and focusing on expansion and acquisition strategies
which began in the second half of twenty sixteen designed to continue to open up capacity in our growing markets and help combat a tight labor market in particular the midwest
the fold as it relates to our pipeline we're continuing to explore opportunities across all three of our primary market sectors and so again we're going to continue to evaluate those and stay disciplined to our approach but
i would now like to turn the call over to todd cleveland thank you julie ann and thank you all for joining us on the call today this morning we'd like to discuss the company's first quarter twenty seventeen results and provide an update on the major markets we serve
of eight companies we acquired in twenty sixteen and the focus and dedication of our five thousand-plus team members on ensuring that our customers are always our top priority and are provided the highest level of quality service
overall our ongoing assessment of both the short-term and long-term opportunities and risks for our business model supports our belief that the rv industry is positioned to grow well above the rvia's current forecast
on the mh side we continue to believe there is significant potential for this market in the long term based on the current upward trend we are experiencing in shipment levels
we'll then conclude by providing an update on our overall business outlook the first quarter of fiscal two thousand and seventeen started out strong and right in line with our expectations we were very pleased with our revenue and profitability growth which reflected the continued successful execution
the first quarter of twenty seventeen continued to outperform with strong retail shows and favorable demographic patterns continuing to drive and support increased production levels
and were down slightly by approximately one percent for the same period primarily as a result of continued weakness in the canadian dollar
our capital allocation strategy in twenty seventeen includes continued investment in aligning our facilities with core oem expansion efforts and ensuring we are well positioned to support the growth in all of our markets
we completed and integrated ten acquisitions which broadened our diversified platform
it is quite common for a company to have a filing extension following an auditor transition though we expect to remain a timely filer by filing within the fifteen-day extension period
in two thousand fifteen we appointed a global chief actuary and added a new chief pricing and new chief reserving actuarial positions
has kpmg completed its work on your reserves
as i mentioned in my remarks the -- we sort of have grown up through the it world and are well known in that world our product's getting pulled out of it
and what was striking in the seventy-some-odd conversations that i had is that in the eyes of the customer servicenow is addressing a need that the other platforms weren't really designed to do
we can now sell something else and potentially do an hr replacement to begin or a new hr implementation because many times
the benefits of scale that allows that kind of focus on a y two k account which whether it's not yet a customer
i guess the lesson i learned from the consumer internet is eight years ago there was all this talk about the big platforms potentially competing with one another and if you look at what happened most of them
because customers are asking that but we've been hearing that same thing for the last five years quite frankly
we're well known within it and with cios but our platform is being aggressively deployed outside of it to provide real value in areas such as hr security and customer service
is there a lot of heavy lifting i guess left to do to kind of get you -- people are already using you outside of it what do you think has to happen to sort of take that next step to start talking to more line of business heads and ceo types
when i stepped down as ceo of ebay i had the opportunity to survey the technology landscape and it became clear to me that cloud businesses are disrupting both consumer and enterprise experiences for the better
i've been onboard for a little over three weeks and have had the good fortune of spending that time listening and learning from our customers partners and employees
in dialogues with our customers already i feel like i can relate to what the c-suite is looking for from our platform and others
january one on the disclosure side we will be disclosing quarterly what's required on the backlog and deferred revenue and then how that backlog is going to roll off into revenue over the next twelve months
and believe the timing was right to accelerate the CEO change while still allowing me the opportunity to help darren until i retire
including our customers our employees and the investment community james's vision has been instrumental to the evolution of yrc worldwide and i am grateful for his contributions and personal support
as the operating officer for the company the last three months that's been a focus of mine across all of our companies
while yrc freight reported improved financial results over last year we are far from satisfied with our overall performance
we could see something more in two q is that cautiousness or is there some other item we need to be cognizant of that could impact q two and prevent you from seeing
i guess what needs to change whether it's culturally or cost structure wise what needs to be accelerated to maybe get that or down and how quickly can you get there
or coming off lease we are purchasing those as we are able so you'll see more purchases in twenty eighteen than we've done in the recent past
turning to q one the overall financial results were in line with our expectations and let me reiterate what we said we would do
these charges will not impact the company's cash balance or liquidity and will be excluded from adjusted ebitda and from operating income
that's the piece that we started addressing in the middle of two thousand and seventeen i feel like we have a good handle on it it's a continuous improvement process but it's also being addressed in all of our contract negotiations
or these tractors that may come on the market here over the next six to nine months is that even being contemplated or is it sort of new and i guess why
the eight new distribution centers we discussed last year as part of our latest network enhancement became fully operational in the first quarter of twenty eighteen and are handling freight as designed
thank you operator i'm excited about the opportunity that we have at yrc worldwide and i certainly have a great deal of confidence in our leadership team
with growth above ten percent we were exceptionally pleased with this performance which resulted primarily from improved client demand
we were very pleased to see the safety assessment margin above twenty percent again and believe that we will continue to drive further improvement
we expect two thousand sixteen to be a more robust year for revenue growth because of the strength of demand combined with enhanced strategies for partnering with clients
segment operating margins are expected to be driven primarily by a modest improvement in the manufacturing support segment as well as a slightly higher dsa margin excluding wil
contributed a net two hundred and thirty basis points to the dsa operating margin in the fourth quarter but because the credits are now subject to tax
due to the planned acquisition of wil research and our goal to quickly repay debt cash flow generation has become an ever-greater focus for us
to be able to employ those benefits to the wil organization as we bring them closer to charles river so a couple of years to get
will be a key component of revenue growth in two thousand sixteen and that our ability to provide a total microbial testing solution to our clients
such as the dedicated integration team we established in two thousand fifteen identifying and hiring the best scientific and operational personnel
organic growth is expected to be driven by improving trends in our rms and discovery businesses
the rms operating margin is expected to be relatively flat
and implementing additional projects to enhance the automation and efficiency of other businesses through it investments
we're not engaging with wil's clients because they're not our clients at the current time we have an understanding of who they are we have kind of some euphemistic understanding of their initial reactions to the deal
the successful execution of our strategy to position charles river as the early-stage research partner of choice a position that we believe will be enhanced by the pending acquisition of wil research
we are investing a significant amount of time meeting wil's management and continue to be very impressed with their scientific expertise operational capabilities and client focus
so that we can lower our leverage to less than three times ebitda within eighteen months of the close
you may recall that our safety assessment business in canada recognizes the majority of its revenue in us dollars
the effect of the change is a reduction of operating income and an increase in our non-gaap tax rate
as a result of various important factors including but not limited to those discussed in our annual report on form ten-k which was filed on february seventeen two thousand and fifteen as well as other filings we make with the securities and exchange commission
when including the expected impact from the wil acquisition the revenue growth rate on a constant currency basis
we had discussed our expectation for a better second half of two thousand and fifteen which was based primarily on the anniversaries of the nci contract cancellation in the third quarter
we continue to identify opportunities to streamline our rms operations particularly through the automation of manual processes and implementation of systems to improve data availability and accuracy
will compress our margin expansion in two thousand and sixteen but we are confident that we will be able to leverage our growth and enhanced infrastructure to drive greater margin expansion over the longer term
the combination of these factors is expected to result in first quarter non-gaap eps approximately ten percent below the fourth quarter
that line double in size against a revenue base that's only gone up maybe fifty percent and i'm wondering -- and i know you're in an investment phase here but
we believe that these non-gaap financial measures help investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects consistent with the manner in which management measures and forecasts the company's performance
we believe that we have established a sophisticated and disciplined integration process leveraging dedicated staff and improving upon and learning from prior acquisitions especially wil
extending the maturity date three years beyond the credit facilities and providing additional capacity to support our acquisition strategy
assumes sequential expansion of our operating margin in the manufacturing and dsa segments
we will provide further details on mpi shortly but let me begin by giving you the highlights of our first quarter performance
gems continues to benefit from our clients use of crispr and other technologies to create genetically modified models faster and more cost-effectively
we also increased our reported revenue growth guidance by two hundred basis points to reflect a more favorable benefit from foreign exchange
including inbred models for genetic modification and immunodeficient models for oncology research and innovative technologies like crispr as critical tools to more narrowly target
this year we are focused on the integration of mpi and the continued execution of our strategy
i'd like to provide you with details on the first quarter segment performance beginning with the rms segment
we believe that our focus on optimizing our infrastructure will help us improve the operating margin over the long term and maintain it in the high-twenty percent range
in addition to the lower tax rate we also expect a small incremental eps benefit from foreign exchange
the foreign exchange benefit for the year creates a meaningful headwind to the dsa operating margin
these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure
this was evident this quarter in several ways firstly since our portfolio consists primarily of adjustable rate loans our gross yield increased in all three of our small balance commercial business lines
this underscores our premise that the sbc market is earlier in the credit cycle and more correlated to the strong housing market
slide nine summarizes our residential mortgage business our strategy has been to retain the servicing rights on loans sold which increase in value in a rising rate environment
i know the sba product is also protected as you guys just mentioned and that's very unique to your platform but it seems like fannie would be a very natural fit and extension for you guys
we haven't committed to that certainly that would be great if we could do that but our goal is to get it over ten percent certainly by the end of the year
therefore you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them we refer you to our sec filings for more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our future operating results and financial condition
we were able to leverage the skills of our gmfs the residential business that stand in that area to help underwrite and
the sale of the segment frp is something that we actually consider as well as the preparation for our further growth ideas that we have it will focus the management
we have two effects we have the one effect that we have stockpiled a couple of anodes here and there because we had some smaller maintenance issues
looking ahead raw material availability will remain sound through large carryover stocks from the record twenty seventeen crop and very positive new season crop expectations
whilst we expect the competitive environment to remain the additional kzn baking capacity that was successfully commissioned in december
so far the impact of the latter two is being negligible and we are optimistic that the formal will yield margin relief in the second half
the investment in two thousand and seventeen was exceptionally low because of the major deflation in soft commodities during that period as well as imports
between the time that you'd experience from order to delivery market as well as redistribution to shelf and tabletop create some challenges because the zar moves relative to the foreign currencies quite significantly
it's also pleasing to note that the strong global demand for sa vine fruit continues
availability of wheat in the long term or the medium term to be sufficient so we always tried on the import parity mechanism we've rationalized our wheat milling footprint to five mills which we operate now
that we shared with you in the past that said the share of most power brands improved in the context of growing categories within the defined channel sasko bread and spekko rice being the exceptions
unfortunately markets like drc and zimbabwe continue to be a drag on the portfolio given the prevailing macro conditions
and this has been exacerbated by the competition for the sa vine crop
more than half of customer care interactions and twenty six percent of commercial transactions were done through digital channels together with
year-to-date in the first six months you lost about two hundred thousand it looks like there's an increase happening in your consumer line loss i was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of color on what's going on there is it just the pickup in competitive intensity we've seen this year
with an average maturity of bonds longer than seven years
since the first quarter of twenty seventeen we provide you with the figures in terms of watching how convergence is delivering
i still think that it will not be as sustainable for -- in the long term for four players to be in the french market
it seems to me like the government and the public authorities are a little bit worried that five g deployment might not go as quickly as they would hope probably
our strategy based on differentiation for quality and premium services is bearing fruits as the premium mix is improving by three points year-on-year
the new deal is a commitment of four telecom players on the french market to accelerate
this presentation will be posted on our website and includes an appendix with footnotes and the reconciliations of gaap to adjusted numbers please also refer to tables included in our earnings press release for a reconciliation of gaap to the adjusted numbers that we will be discussing
the expected transition of the catamaran business at the end of two thousand fifteen and into two thousand sixteen of which the primary services provided were formulary management
i'll now turn it over to george for his comments thank you tim this is my last earnings call as chairman and ceo and
patient cost compared to what the ideal would be and we hold ourselves to a very high standard on both of those and we see that as a significant differentiator and a significant opportunity for the next three to five years
in eighteen years we've had dozens of earnings calls hundreds of investor conferences and thousands of meetings with you
where we looked at their eight thousand diabetes patients and four thousand of those patients were not on an ace or an arb despite being at the age where they should be
those two which were a result of acquisitions not a result of losing a client per se
in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors which are discussed in detail in the company's most recent form ten-k filed with the securities and exchange commission
so from that standpoint i would not read through the -- what has been a sequencing of ebitda that i've seen for most of my eighteen years in this business anything different as it relates to that in our first quarter results
is that in fact there are a lot of clients that have always believed in mail that continue to believe in mail that are working with us to support mail and increasingly we're seeing health plans move that direction and so we've had several large health plans in the last six months
literally almost zero folks go the other way and step out of it and we continue to have plans come into it we increasingly also are seeing health plans looking to potentially clone it
a where we've seen over the last six months or so a bunch of interesting assets trade in specialty space
could you maybe speak to the quality of the new client opportunities for this year because the past say twelve to eighteen months or so has had a fair share of unique circumstances that
and so the question is how much worse would that be if you didn't have an independent pbm and i think what actually -- our mission is not to be constrained by any other
millions of changes that come into that all get initiated on january one our call center people have to be prepared for that our account management teams have to work with our clients on it
and that could have been worth billions of dollars and so when you put those two together we think we've been more than fair in offering a very good
for example during a recent storm that caused hundreds of flight cancellations one of our customers used this technology to determine a crew recovery four times faster than current industry benchmarks
and the anniversary of the expiration of the service contract we previously discussed at the beginning of q four last year
we're actually doing a little bit better this year than what we expected so we're in between that forty percent and forty two percent but again we expect it to be closer in the medium term
throughout today's call we will be presenting certain non-gaap financial measures which have been adjusted to exclude expenses and other gains or losses related to restructuring -- restructurings litigation and tax matters and certain other items
in travel network with the anniversary of the acquisition of our asia pacific business on july one revenue and bookings growth over the balance of the year will return to normalized growth rates reflecting our global footprint
we will continue to improve our cost position and i am very pleased that we achieved underlying margin improvement in this quarter as well as two thousand and sixteen in total and we will continue
delivering better results ebit-wise in orkla care this time you're well below and you have even had to spend more advertising money
in two thousand and sixteen we have closed down six factories and started the process of closing down another eight and we believe that capex levels will remain
try to predict these effects as you know and i don't guide on that but it's a fact of the matter that in theory there are more selling days in q one this year
popcorn in three different tastes and popcorn are naturally high on fiber and is probably the most healthy snack you can eat
as well as a few sort of smaller ones arm in boston and a few other things so we'll be very active in the next
with whom we're working on on some of the crispr activities that we're doing so we look forward to a very full day and an informative day tomorrow here in new york
what's interesting to actually note about it is that there's been an uptick in the number of diagnoses in the past two years i think because more clinicians are becoming more familiar with these diseases
data package no other program in the world has been able to show any form of combination of reductions of gags in the csf reductions of
in riio-two one of the aspects highlighted in the framework is the requirement of each company to develop customer engagement groups
which is somewhat new we had already put that into our plans for riio-ed one which i think helped justify
while rav growth and recovery would be lower over the longer term another important point ofgem confirmed last week was the use of economic asset life
we are custom to at ppl these achievements across our utilities reflect our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and our strategy for growth and success
a reduction from the eight-year period we're currently in for riio-one while we certainly prefer the stability and benefits to customers
going through h one both of these will flip once our investment program has been completed
you may remember this time around january last year i talked about uk returns going down for the first time that i could remember
so that's how we sequence the plan now what i also said to you is once we've broken the back of the eurohub which the mission was to land the eurohub and from zero to that is the most intense the rest of it is easy
so as with all algorithm driven engines we'll continue to refine that as you put the output back into the import and it refines going forward so that's an important step in our new retail systems using ai to guide our clearance activity
in retail anyway i think we should get faster to help our suppliers particularly asos design and own brand but we just need to bed in what we've done and we'll get better from here
and then dial up the dm that's normally the fastest way to destroy customer confidence and the fastest way to destroy value at the same time so i think we've actually sequenced it in that way
the rates quoted are for days currently contracted the actual rates to be earned in the first quarter two thousand and nineteen will therefore depend on the number of additional days that we can contract
not only no dividend paid for the fourth quarter but really no mention of strategy for twenty nineteen other than saying
the reports that the company files or furnishes with the sec corporate governance information and select press releases and social media postings
we also took substantive actions on our simplify and streamline initiative during q one we increased focus on our rest of the world segment and exited our shopping businesses in japan and brazil two of our top ten countries
mobile remains our focus with nearly sixty percent of transactions completed on our mobile platforms
in the first quarter strong operating fundamentals were the largest contributor to our revenue and adjusted ebitda performance
billings and gross profit declined on an absolute dollars basis our decision to close countries and fx were significant contributors
earlier this month we exited russia through a divestiture of the business bringing our country total to twenty seven we are also continuing to invest in building centralized deal factory operations and improve capabilities in customer service
we believe that our new cohorts are in a good place as we think about roi the gross profit dollars generated by the new cohorts are consistent with the historical cohort performance and within the twelve- to eighteen-month payback
finally let me touch on our efforts to improve the groupon customer experience we added this as one of our strategic priorities in twenty sixteen because it is a massive opportunity area
there's much more to do here but the team is hard at work and the progress we've made in our other strategic priorities gives us the opportunity to expand our customer experience efforts throughout the balance of two thousand and sixteen coming out of the first quarter
that we originally discussed in q three we will continue to monitor and report on our progress
adjusting for changes like our increased marketing spend and cash payments under our restructuring program including cash used to fund country exits our q one free cash flow fits within our historical range
as always our overall guidance reflects current fx rates and our results may be materially affected by various factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding the global economy and consumer spending as well as exchange rate fluctuation
change has been a constant at groupon and i would argue that over the past five months we've changed more and faster than at any time in my nearly five years at this company
we added one million incremental new customers as our spending mix shifted to acquisition from our historical transactional tactics
we've covered a lot of ground yet we remain in the early days across all four of our strategic initiatives
and i'm just curious how that would compare to sites that have yet to be reimaged i think the two percent is a really good number that's what we see inside outside
and with this minimum -- i mean having to pay minimum wage and overtime to a hundred percent commissioned salespeople it's just an odd thing for me and we decided we just had to come up with
as a result we expect more stable growth rates in fiscal 'seventeen if we look at our performance by developed and emerging markets we see a consistent performance with both growing net sales three percent this year
this was attributable to the weakness in nigeria brazil and the export channel in west lac as i discussed earlier
should have a positive operating profit impact in fiscal 'seventeen thereby increasing ebitda both of these factors should play towards improving our leverage ratio
distill ventures is our brand incubator it has already made ten investments of which the most recent is our investment in seedlip this is as the entrepreneur behind the brand says
our results in fiscal 'sixteen were a good set of results and they delivered on our specific goals for the year and we gained ground against our performance ambition
to support this in the last three years we've put new leaders in over half of our top management positions
ivan will talk more about our outlook for us spirits in fiscal 'seventeen later
in latin america and caribbean net sales were up about one percent with a weaker second half due to the unwind of advanced purchasing in the first half ahead of the december duty increase in brazil
right now our leverage ratio is squarely within the two point five x to three times range we target as a result we are not yet in a position of having excess capital to deploy
and i would expect to deliver further progress against these measures in fiscal 'seventeen in addition to continuing to execute our strategy
and as a global manufacturer we are committed to protecting the environment earlier this month we announced a five-year international partnership with water aid
and over the next five years i am confident this will unlock greater growth
the solution to the problem of what to drink when you are not drinking nonalcoholic it has two variants designed to be drunk
it will be delivered in five areas the first pillar is net revenue management we believe we can access significant value in headline pricing the effectiveness of our trade investment and promotional spend
in fiscal 'seventeen we're transforming the program again to ensure it remains at the cutting edge of marketing thinking and building in the latest technology around measurement and evaluation
in addition to delivering our goals in fiscal 'sixteen we also returned our global giants to growth and achieved a significant improvement in the performance of our scotch and beer portfolios
what i'd like to focus on now is the deep dive into the drivers of the three percent improvement in organic net sales growth versus last year with all of our regions delivering improvement
i would expect other finance charges to increase next year with higher pension costs and the recognition of the increase in value of zacapa our adjusted net debt-to-ebitda ratio
please let me share with you how we see foreign exchange impacting our fiscal 'seventeen results
we have a few points of emphasis in fiscal 'seventeen growing our scotch business
we've worked with them for over the last fifteen years so we know that our longer-term commitment can make an even bigger difference to communities where water is a scarce resource
up ten percent for fiscal 'seventeen our strategy for johnnie walker is to recruit consumers through four pillars consistently and beautifully executed
you may not have heard about third space but i'm sure you've been there those consumer occasions which are not in traditional on-trade or at-home occasions
and expected to grow double digit third space does present logistical challenges but we intend to lead here ensuring our brands take full advantage of this cultural phenomenon
and this focus is set to continue from fiscal 'seventeen we will increase efficiency as agency costs and point-of-sale spend will be managed through global procurement
fiscal 'seventeen our fiscal 'sixteen performance came from strong execution it is the result of the changes we made the consumer is at the heart of our business
the return to volume growth in fiscal 'sixteen was a key driver fueling our top line with improved volume growth in all regions and a significant turnaround in us spirits
smirnoff is up two percent we are continuing to focus on recruiting millennial consumers through the brand's inclusivity message positioning the brand at the right price and providing standout packaging
turning to category performance scotch improved significantly moving from a five percent decline last year to a bit better than flat this year
the cost of restructuring changes were offset by savings from our january twenty fourteen global efficiency program and increased gains from land sales this year
there are still a few variables around exchange in fiscal 'seventeen which could affect this forecast
and we intend to make it even stronger so let me now cover the three areas where we will dial up focus to drive further improvement in fiscal 'seventeen starting with scotch
so in fiscal 'seventeen we will invest more behind these growth drivers with a digitally led plan to drive even more brand awareness
this is an exciting innovation potentially creating a new category and we are there from the start route to consumer has been an area of major focus for three years but it's still an area of opportunity
on the development of a new collaborative design methodology such as the extremo platform which will materially change the way we manage our projects
the remaining seven topside models and jacket are planned to be removed
i want to thank everyone at era for their diligence and achieving our objective of zero era accidents in q one twenty sixteen extending the clean sheet
from a strategic standpoint we did note the preference to build liquidity during q one given the uncertainty around the ultimate
in response to this accident each of the norwegian and uk civil aviation authorities
turning briefly to the highlights of era's q one results i am pleased to report that despite the challenging conditions in the oil and gas industry
as well as poor weather conditions and poor hours of daylight which impact oil and gas operations q one of this year was no different
we continue to believe that twenty sixteen will be an even more difficult year than twenty fifteen we remain focused on maintaining the best safety standards maximizing the utilization of our helicopter fleet
so the market actually comes down fourteen percent but if you look at the purchase market it goes up
we hope that the information was helpful in gaining an appreciation for our unique and differentiated position in the market and the value that that brings to our clients cbiz also celebrated our twentieth anniversary in august
as a reminder most of these engagements are multiyear in nature and are periodically renewed through a formal rfp process our success rate in winning rfps continues to be very high
within our retirement plan services business we benefited in twenty fifteen from a number of large projects in our actuarial business
and there are a number of other areas within each of the core businesses including the combination as i alluded to earlier of the payroll and the benefits and the technology what we call eso on employee benefits side we see
what is the level of optimism and i will tell you that there is a higher level of optimism today than there certainly was a year ago or two years ago at this point
and although not materially impacting revenue in twenty sixteen we are encouraged by the early reception that we're receiving from our clients
compared with eighty five days a year ago with our seasonal billing and collection cycle
a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measures can be found in the financial tables of today's press release
the pretax margin contribution from this business has also improved by fifty basis points this year and we are pleased to report that the growth continues to come from both our government health care consulting business and our core accounting business
when we go to market by combining our payroll our benefits and our hr technology services into an integrated service offering to our clients
we are achieving a slightly lower effective tax rate for state income taxes this year and we continue to expect an effective rate of approximately forty percent for the full year this year
many of the listeners on today's call participated in the analyst day that we held on the -- held at the new york stock exchange on september thirteen in addition to the high-level overview of the company that we often provide in our investor meetings
to ohtwenty five it will be a significant move but we consider that it is one of the rules of insurance company and in general of investors
the first group of hotels using this new revenue management tool is showing a two hundred sixty basis point increase in revpar index compared with hotels not yet on the system
the effect of these two transactions is now included in our updated interest expense guidance
the reconciliation of these measures to gaap is provided in the tables to the press release
of twenty sixteen so now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units
down at wvo as well as to a degree the opening of the new sales offices some of our sales offices
and that number also includes a twenty percent increase in domestic new construction activity with the concentration in our higher end brands
we're reiterating total company as well as business unit revenue adjusted ebitda and driver guidance although our current view is that revpar will be at the low end of our guidance range
can you just talk about what your plans are for that over the next twelve months in terms of say exiting rooms from the system and what we can reasonably expect
strong performance at our two owned hotels and cost containment measures more than offset weaker global revpar these factors also led to a higher margin for the quarter
and the respect of this industry and i think it's improved dramatically if you followed this industry fifteen years ago and you look at it now
my explanation follows the presentation materials entitled results for the nine months ended december two thousand and fifteen which is shown in the center of the viewing screen please turn to page two of the materials
i would like to highlight two main points first although performance in the non-resource field was firm lower market prices on resource commodities led to a decline in the resource field
but continues to grow nicely not only through our banking customers but through partnerships that we do through eps and we've talked about some of those in the past
i mentioned that nineteen customers signed with us today that were never on the old platform so it's not that we'll be migrating them
it's -- it was just a really good quarter it was a nice mix of the three buckets of
and then of those ten are those competitive takeaways or are those banks that are looking to grow and want to establish a commercial banking
i did yesterday for the first time see a survey that some bankers were starting to get a little bit concerned about -- as they look into calendar twenty twenty starting to get concerned about the
through signing customers because they like the functionality that we have particularly with the pscu technology laying over the top so
maybe looking at partnerships and building that ecosystem out more so than you would've thought a year ago or eighteen months ago or do you feel like anything your customers are looking for if you can't find a way to acquire it you've got the bandwidth and the resources to develop it internally
about a ten percent and that was just through normal attrition and we just didn't add any of those people obviously if they have a key position
that slide as it relates to the growth in revenue per employee and how we've driven operating margins up very steadily over the last five years
we're in the mix we're constantly looking for them and we get phone calls from time to time to focus on very very large transactions but we did not have a large transaction in q one as it relates to the confidence on fannie coming back into the market
as it relates to the rest of two thousand and eighteen we have already seen fannie mae come back into the market and it is our clear expectation that fannie will capture its historic market share of total multifamily lending this year
the jcr acquisition now gives us a platform that combines our access to deal flow with sources of capital looking to invest
we expressly disclaim any obligation to do so more detailed information about risk factors can be found in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec i will now turn the call over to willy
do you have any color you could provide on what percentage of adjusted ebitda comes from servicing is it well more than half considering the size and duration of the servicing portfolio
just look at their track record they've got huge amounts of dry powder they've got the ability to deploy massive amounts of capital and we've been their largest partner for four of the last six years
that has forty qualified bidders which is a much broader investor base than either of the past two years
we made significant progress towards achieving these two goals with the recent acquisition of jcr capital and the hiring of a fantastic team of investment sales professionals
what jcr allows us to do is to focus on providing that type of capital to the rest of the market
thank you i'd like to welcome everyone on the call today the news release announcing capstone's twenty eighteen third quarter financial results
for further information on these risks and uncertainties please see capstone's relevant filings on sedar finally i'll just note that all amounts we will discuss today will be in us dollars unless otherwise specified
at deutsche bank we're undertaking as much restructuring as possible in twenty sixteen despite the burden of lost revenues and added expense in the year
we did fail to come through the ccar process for our small trust bank successfully
which will be published late friday for the largest fifty one banks in europe and on deutsche bank's funding profile
which will have a positive rwa impact in q three losses in the quarter includes specific valuation impacts related to these transactions
wealth management revenues were down twelve percent versus an exceptionally strong second quarter 'fifteen driven by a bit difficult market environment with lower client activity
the revenues benefited from the ipo of red rock resorts we also got approval from the port authority for the sale of the maher terminal during the quarter
because you run parallel with the people that you bring into the inside and it takes three to four months until you actually release people on the outside and if you add all that up
kindly like to refer people to rather than us speculating on what ecb eba are going to do
with an agreement on job cuts that affects approximately three thousand staff members and enables us to announce our branch closure program
our renewed emphasis on the consumer finance market in germany to boost margins and reduce our concentration on mortgages led to a five percent growth in new customer volumes
in ncou we continue to liquidate positions even though the environment was not always conducive to doing so
we expect to continue for several quarters to come with our ongoing enhancements to our kyc processes and with expanding our orders in compliance functions
even though we face a slight delay compared to our initial time plan we're still highly confident to close the deal in the second half of two thousand and sixteen after maximum three-month approval period
looking into adjusted costs in more detail on page seven you'll see four main categories with the following movements at constant fx rates
investment and insurance revenues as well as deposit income were down credit products showed a solid growth of six percent driven by higher volumes
yes so i mean that is more -- so what i just said is more really in relation to how we manage two thousand and sixteen to make sure that
revenues declined by twelve percent in a challenging market this resulted from lower revenues in our corporate finance business with revenues from transaction banking being almost flat
we are already making plans to collapse the noncore unit at year-end and migrate any residual rwa back into the core bank
i was wondering if at this point given that it's all being set up you could update us as to what is the capital position of the whole ihc today what is the total average exposure
potential ipo your optionality around that and what you think
well stay tuned and i'll update you on our arc customer and usage metrics as well as a number of important milestones that bear evidence that arc is gaining traction and indeed has the potential to drive very significant growth for the company
in one case we completed the implementation of a large supplier on an erp that we had integrated to before in under four weeks
the one i mentioned sihl was on sage x three is the name of their erp we have to build those connectors we've gotten good at that so the fact that we could get a company like sihl up and running actually live with customers in just under eight weeks and do a connector
provide us with an invoice number and an invoice amount to kind of authenticate themselves that they can get invoices or they are getting invoices from the supplier and then sign up to start working on arc so that's one example
all right so now i'm going to turn my attention to arc and take a few minutes to outline the progress we've been making in the solutions business
in another case sihl the manufacturer that we announced recently we were able to get them live in eight weeks and this on sage x three an erp system that was new to us
that articulate the variety of benefit to the end customer and by doing inserts and onserts with their own paper invoices to give end customers the opportunity to come to the supplier's website and sign up for arc in a couple of simple steps
there are over seventy five qualified opportunities currently being worked on by sales more than half of which could close in the next one to two quarters
speaks to the fact that we can do these projects quickly clearly whenever we build a connector we want to leverage that and win more customers on that connector because then we're talking about four weeks and maybe even less than four weeks to get them live
this adjustment had the effect of distorting our revenues gross profit margins and ebitda so during my discussion i will try to discuss key results with and without the chase rebate
the past three months we've combined a couple of related companies that were in our supplier account and we did have two companies drop off our list so as a net result we've seen an increase of five new suppliers over the period
we're also seeing a general increase in the size of the opportunities in the pipeline of our first twenty five suppliers we have several that measure their monthly invoice volumes in the hundreds
the other half on longer sales cycles based on indications from the prospects the former represent about two point four million invoices per month in new volume
another is an erp vendor a vendor to some of our existing arc customers
you're working on but are you -- can you give us an idea of what kind of level of serious negotiation of that seventy five that are quite advanced
they can market to their customers quite effortlessly within arc to convince or to encourage their customers to sign up we're also talking about doing call center-oriented call-down campaigns to the customers that haven't signed
a generally weak canadian economy a strong us dollar and a very warm weather last winter that significantly impacted our ski resort operators who are key customers of ours in the wintertime
when we approached them about establishing a referral arrangement to reach many more of their customers not only were they interested they have since signed up to use arc themselves that is they will use arc to invoice those very same customers we'll be selling to
yes certainly and so there's three different discussions we're having right now and we're going to be starting up a few more discussions with banks as well because we're seeing a lot of interest
building a lot of results from banks in certainly the first half of twenty sixteen but we're going to work hard on signing at least one deal
what we'll be doing is putting -- in a run of invoices putting an insert in the envelope kind of a marketing slick that tells them about arc
will be positive but not material mainly in our decision division
looking at the regional bank's balance sheet on slide seven you can see the strong growth in multiple areas of our commercial portfolios
along with that from ge capital and feel very good about the prospects of that business as we look into
you'll hear more from bj as we talk about expenses but expense control and creating operating leverage is still going to be a primary focus of what we're doing
wrapping up on slides twelve and thirteen i think we're pleased with both the strong quarter we had and the positive momentum we still see in our businesses from a bonefish perspective we ticked off a lot of improvement boxes
i'm sorry if i missed it what was the reason why we didn't see more expense leverage at ftn this quarter
the third quarter we saw very good revenues trends in the first two months of the quarter they moderated some in september
commercial real estate growth was largely driven by the funding up of prior commitments yet we remain active in the broader cre market
integrating very very well into our culture and our organization and are very happy to be here and we're happy to have them so ten people a couple million dollars to support
i think we're starting to see what bryan talked about in terms of cre trends emerging right now and we've had several examples of that occurring
particularly as it allows us to generate relatively consistent ebitda despite the significant drop in commodity prices and industry activity
in addition the highly competitive and weak short-term rental market was particularly challenging and had a significant negative impact on canada's ebit in the fourth quarter
pretty well through 'fifteen on the parts side where we saw some weakness was on the construction side and when i talked about people not running to the year-end there was
and capital efficiencies and we are confident in the resiliency of our business model which will support our ebitda and strong free cash flow conversion going forward
most recently we were selected to supply equipment and services for the site c project in bc this is a considerable win that includes fifty articulated trucks and thirty five off-highway trucks scheduled for delivery beginning in the first half of this year
our goal is to climb back to six percent to seven percent ebit margin as we continue to manage through weak and uncertain market conditions and transform the canadian business for sustainable profitability in the long term
your product support was down seven percent as reported against this somewhat difficult prior year comparable so i'm just curious how you interpret the performance of that business in the quarter
as a result we came into two thousand and fifteen with a solid financial position and clear priorities underscored by cost and capital discipline
and we began reshaping our facility network which will effectively translate to a twenty percent reduction of our footprint while leveraging field service delivery to get closer to our customers
as scott mentioned our track record of generating relatively consistent ebitda throughout the economic cycles speaks to the resiliency of our business model
i think the benefit we have here is the alignment with cat and finning we are fighting tooth and nail to make sure we
so you were talking about o two o and you were talking about advertisements but that's an area of your strength from the past so for financial services and its monetization as you strive to make progress i think there's a lot of still missing pieces
and we are growing in these kpis and what will be generated through the enhancement of these three kpis it is written on the top half
regarding paypay and the way users are increasing what is the image of growth so you -- six million
in april i believe it was the seventh we showed it to our employees and we shared it together and it was a way of encouraging our people to change with speed
so thinking about the policies and based on our policies we need to create an environment -- we created an environment back in twenty eighteen so that we could
and in twenty nineteen we should try to leverage on that lessons learned so that we will be able to revamp our growth
out of the six million users i think so far should we think that most of them are active users and with the campaigns in place are you expecting to gradually increase your user-base
so various pieces of data acquisition is what we are trying to do we're working hard to do so and we're trying to look at a variety of options ozawa-san do you have anything to say are you talking about pos data for example
pursue growth so in earnest in fiscal twenty nineteen the future vision of yahoo is something we would like to achieve and realized
engineering and development increased seventy six percent for the full year due to the same factors
but also making sure we're getting our fair share in smb because we are seeing attractive economics there
we're pretty far along in that and especially as we continue to invest in the one v platform
looking statements based on the business environment as we currently see it and as such does include certain risks and uncertainties please refer to our press release and our sec filings
as noted in our earnings release we have posted supplemental financial information on the ir portion of our website
the sophistication of our analytics and the extensive experience of our team which spans over twelve years has allowed us to effectively manage credit quality through product launches
in uk we continue to demonstrate our ability to grow a profitable business
for example we could achieve the high end of our revenue guidance range while following in the low end of the adjusted ebitda range during a period of high growth with a high proportion of new customers
the decline in the international gross profit margin was driven by the impact of the discontinued uk line of credit product
in addition to the gaap reporting we report certain financial measures that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles
we discussed this in detail on our last earnings call during q three we made the decision to maintain strong short-term profitability in the face of heavy demand from new customers
the discontinued uk line of credit product and the impact of the exchange rate for the british pound following the brexit vote
as we entered q four we had to then get the growth engine back going and it's not a switch you can just
i'm starting on slide three we're very pleased that encorafenib and binimetinib new drug applications and marketing authorization applications
compared to the control arm secondary endpoints include an os comparison of the doublet to the control arm and the triplet to the doublet the study includes a thirty-patient safety lead-in to
and the presence of a ras mutation who have received at least one prior line of therapy and no more than two prior lines of therapy and the trial contains a phase ib study to determine the maximum tolerated dose
is likely to do we had a phase ii result that went all the way to os with the doublet and so that's going to be helpful in order to assess the ultimate
moving towards the premium end of the sectors in which we trade systematically raising the quality of amenity right across our portfolio and getting on to that six- to seven-year cycle of investment that tim talked about
ignite two is a huge program of work and i realize i'm asking a lot of my team to do this on top of their job but in a funny sort of way i feel it's energized the business and it's given people a vision and a purpose
some of those work streams i've already started to see some of their initiatives land in the business and rally to start accruing whereas others are far longer term and may well require net investment this year but will pay back from fy 'twenty and beyond so for example
trustee to start using cpi to index pensions for those people
and in many ways ignite two ensures that we can move apace while we do this and finally driving an innovation agenda which is about making the technology in the business
during half two of last year we also did a lot of work on our menus ensuring for example that we don't carry too many orphan products those are products that only appear in one or two dishes
in exchange for eight million shares of common stock as well as convertible preferred stock that if converted in full would equate to another forty two million shares of common stock
so i'd like to provide a recap of the overall deal with spi to put this into context
the rationale for the company sending the notice is simply that the supply agreement is a vital part of the overall deal and an essential prerequisite for the other two components to be realized
i think we've seen over the last twelve months a pickup of
as we discussed during last quarter's conference call on two of the five projects
i'm sure many of you have questions about our business situation with spi so i'll take a few minutes to address this topic
first the companies agreed to a supply agreement for forty megawatts of energy storage projects
a failure to execute the forty-megawatt supply agreement in four years results in the warrants going away
both have kicked in kla certainly is a bigger portion since we started that agreement middle of last year and nordson is a very recent agreement that just started
how much of the general purpose three d scanning market is going to be available to us and it's really too early for us to
was driven by robust demand for new three d inspection systems and sensors
that is a fair thing to say yes we just -- i mean as i said kla started just a little more than a year ago and nordson is just a couple of months old agreement right now
again there are different -- i would rather not go and quantify the oem numbers because there's very high sensitivity on
chairman and ceo position i think the board will
in the first quarter of twenty sixteen we identified two events that resulted in material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
those who have participated in our quarterly calls over the last eighteen months have heard me describe the algeco group as a good business with great people
can you guys tell me what twenty seventeen adjusted ebitda was on a pro forma basis had you had those acquisitions in there since the beginning of the year
i have no doubt the journey we embarked on some eighteen months ago would have faltered had it not been for the tireless dedication of our people pushing the business to do better notwithstanding constrained balance sheet and difficult market conditions
how much ebidta did you guys actually see from those acquisitions in q four i'm guessing it was negligible but was it a couple of million bucks or what
our strategy for the last eighteen months has been to maximize the efficiency of each business division in the group while at the same time ensuring that each of those business divisions is capable of operating independently of headquarters
i will hand over to scott who will take you through the q four financials in more detail now
solid cet one ratios with high quality with very small difference between debt phase-in and the fully loaded ratio
perhaps we will see the fully loaded to go down by forty fifty basis points in the following quarters because of this reason
a five percent growth rate on the year despite the negative market effect in recent quarters that has been very relevant
we'll continue to bring clinical sites online and expect four to five other sites to be initiated during november
you see the dlts you have to expand out to six and just your time frame just gets extended so much
or is it due to the excipients so typically we would expect it will take about two weeks in total
for this reason a number of AML patients during the screening process were not enrolled in the trial because of their advanced disease
so while the healthy volunteer study and some of the additional safety studies it requires have moved our ind filing
and what we've said is they have to have a two-month life expectancy to get on to these levels
the protocol requires only one patient at each of the two lowest dose levels
and in parallel performing a healthy volunteer sad study to identify a potential therapeutic dose for the acutely aml patients and then taking that potential therapeutic dose directly into aml patients
and the team of the university of texas md anderson cancer center will present data in a separate poster these presentations will highlight several key findings
that would save us so much time in the aml trial because we're not getting all the negative data from these very ill patients and the risk of having to expand out those dose levels there
some of your findings from preclinical studies that give you confidence that two five three has a safe therapeutic window
and it's because there's a dependency upon the MYC for maintenance of the signaling pathways and viability
the decrease was driven primarily by lower sales to our alternative carrier wireless and cable tv customers
now with that i would like to turn the presentation back over to cheri for her insights into our operations for the fiscal quarter and year-to-date as well as our outlook and strategic initiatives for the remainder of fiscal twenty seventeen and beyond cheri
there has been a lot of excitement speculation and even fear surrounding the arrival of five g and how it may impact our business
all right the next question is how are the certification programs moving forward and what has been the effect of the nebs certification
for these reasons we encourage you to evaluate gross profit on an annual or trailing twelve-month basis
it's important to keep in mind that while clearfield has established significant market share in the tier three markets during the first stage of our growth the market opportunity in front of us as we enter stage two dwarfs the success we have delivered to date
it's really our intention to have the mexican and us operations provide a primary and the secondary source for all of our parts and that will provide us ultimate flexibility and scalability to each plant
our last question is will we be providing guidance for fiscal year 'eighteen revenue and profitability guidance is a difficult challenge especially when you're pursuing significant opportunities with new customers
that said because we report net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis our reported margin will decline six to seven basis points
my last one's really around the shape of the yield curve obviously the five and ten years backed up quite a bit
the opening of these new locations was offset by the announced closing of three of our legacy financial centers as we continue to optimize our financial center footprint
what we needed to do was go out and recruit additional people to draw business in for us and that's exactly what we did we hired two additional producing sales managers in the fourth quarter
our regulatory capital ratios on slide eleven are above the regulatory definition of well capitalized and our internal targets
but for the remaining quarters of 'seventeen i would expect it to revert back
so we're excited to be with you today we feel like we had a really successful first quarter included as you can see in some of the bullet points our earnings per share up thirty percent over
is resulting in expansion in our loan yields and net interest margins as prime and libor increase
i'm not -- i don't have great predictions of those three items each quarter just
they speak in my mind really well to that continued guidance of kind of six percent to eight percent annualized growth despite the fact that the first quarter would argue for something higher than that and that may prove to be the case
well we're just trying to -- the branding the rebranding of what used to be commerce national bank in the first merchants is two years old at this point and so
primarily loans and primarily driven by libor and prime but that allows us to really benefit as rates continue to rise
we've really modeled our margin a couple of different ways with the continued rate hikes and if the december one was the last one what did we expect
we know we are in attractive marketplaces you might have noticed that columbus and indianapolis that we've talked about for years in this thing are two of the markets that are amazon client list so there's people other than first merchants executives that feel like
the margin expectations for the twelve basis points that we'll lose in the calculation based on a lower tax rate
a remarkably different tax equivalent nim in the first quarter of 'eighteen versus the fourth quarter of 'seventeen right and then your actual margin
a little higher than our four-quarter average i think we're looking to try to increase that relationship which will drive
in fosun we are making investment in operation in thirty countries
so we have outstanding people all over the world we also attach importance to nurturing young people many post-eighties people have become our global partners and
you to be able to integrate life work and also tourism in your daily life every day so every day is a holiday foliday last year was listed
so one is our ecosystem and n means
to serve the one billion families in the world we want to develop healthy wealthy and happy ecosystem
at the end of twenty eighteen there was impact from volatility in the capital markets
so with a deep enterprise we see a lot of opportunities for investment in the world and because we have the turnaround ability and we are working on two legs
for your interest in our happiness ecosystem if you look at foliday and yuyuan they are very important platforms and groups
so there will be products and services around these three areas and they will be driven by technology and innovation
we grew slightly above the first quarter almost fifteen percent and in the whole year the growth is almost four percent in the first half of the year which can be
and i think that still affects the company therefore what we see now is an environment where two of the main competitors or maybe two of your largest competitors have problems
and as fred said we do not comment on the mix and the amounts related to pis and cofins we didn't comment on that last year as well
and maybe some products may take up to sixty days to be delivered today and
in the same level of the first quarter of twenty fifteen which was slightly higher but we see a positive trend now
a model whereby they are becoming more verticalized and they are investing in it platforms
good morning everyone and thank you very much for joining us this morning in our conference call so i would like to start on page two where we
we speak about luizacred net income we have two charts one we show net income and the other chart shows operating income when you look at the operating
and i would also like to mention that there was an increase in the tax burden from forty percent to forty five percent on this operating profit and
our first priority is safely executing our work earlier this year we conducted a survey that benchmarked our safety results against more than one thousand other organizations
although we set what i felt was a low bar of attaining historical job-to-date productivity at the end of the second quarter we experienced slightly lower productivity than historical performance in q three and took an additional charge
which provide for the full abatement of country property taxes for each phase's first ten years of operations
some of the milestones that we have to achieve between now and fid are really starting to come into view
at both the cameron lng and freeport lng projects we were back up to full site staff levels within a couple of weeks after the hurricane and continue to make good progress
this is lower than planned due to several large awards pushing to the fourth quarter of this year and the first half of two thousand eighteen it's important to note that we have not lost any significant projects
our fabrication services business continues to deliver reliable underpinning work and really set the pace with an increase in new awards of more than seventy percent versus the year-ago quarter
we announced a catofin technology license award and plan to announce several more awards this quarter including the ethylene technology award in india that we announced just this morning
although it's still early to get too detailed about two thousand eighteen awards let me highlight some of the more notable prospects where we are strongly positioned
i hope i've given you a sense of the strong pipeline for twenty eighteen awards in all the end markets we serve around the world
even one lost time incident is too many and serves as a reminder that we must continue to improve our safety focus and culture to reach our goal of nobody nobody getting hurt
we scored better than eighty four percent of all participating companies this is an excellent score when you take into account the quality of the other companies that we were benchmarked against
the shop is located on an island in the middle of the neches river which rose about twenty feet above normal
it was set two weeks ahead of schedule once complete the meg project will be the largest ethylene glycol plant in the world
definitely seeing more clarity and better progress on the milestones that are needed to get many of these large projects to fid and
which resulted in that charge i think for ipl given that we've achieved first fire
over the next year we are really peaking out here at the end of two thousand and seventeen and we'll be in a steady decline throughout 'eighteen so just in terms of the whole
all of these provide us with a solid foundation for the rest of this year and two thousand and eighteen thank you for your time thank you for participating
by assuring you that we have made a great deal of progress on the key initiatives and decisive actions that i discussed on last quarter's call our intensive efforts remain squarely focused on five key priorities
in fact we achieved first fire just today which is a huge milestone for us and ipl and we will now be focused on completing the commissioning over the next couple of months
which is optimally located close to the permian basin and eagle ford shale nextdecade is led by an experienced team with a proven track record of successful lng project development and marketing
first we've reached a significant milestone of thirty two million work hours without a lost time incident at the cameron lng project
more than three thousand employees took part in the survey with the goal of benchmarking ourselves objectively against more than one thousand other companies and organizations
as you'll recall that our net contract capital position had peaked in the second quarter as a result of the large q two charges we took on the lng projects
we exceeded expectations in q one with significant improvements across all operational metrics just under thirty thousand ounces of production
so to say it differently the lts transaction was funding the purchase of rdm which just happened to be that it did not coincide with the formal closing of the purchase of rdm and the formal closing of the purchase of the -- of the completion of the lts deal
less so for the mexican peso they are stronger than what is in our budget and for the q one average so we do anticipate that there will be some impact to our costs
detailed engineering with a plan to be at ninety percent level of detailed engineering or better before the end of the year
to increase the total resources and to start to develop a plan for development in 'sixteen and 'seventeen between these two years
just with the throughput can you see that going up to the sixty thousand tons
our net pension and opeb liability on our balance sheet decreased
all of which involve a number of business risks and uncertainties and can change as conditions do please review the cautionary statements in our press release and on slide two of today's presentation
the second quarter two thousand eighteen was the first full operational quarter following the renovations of our reading cinemas at elizabeth in south australia and charlestown in new south wales
these two events should continue to enhance our real estate revenues going forward
at the time of our original cannon park acquisition reading controlled over eighty percent of the lot entitlements in the community title scheme via its ownership of twelve of the thirteen lots
referred to as new lot one subsequently reducing the shared ownership common title to a small slither between the new master lot one owned by reading and the existing lot six owned by charter hall
it's clear that moviegoers are continuing to enjoy movies in a theater environment as opposed to tv or on another device as long as theater operators provide quality services and experiences
in late june two thousand eighteen we closed on a strategic acquisition related to our redyard center in auburn a suburb of sydney
the remaining lot entitlements via its ownership of one lot were controlled by charter hall who operates a pub on its lot in the cannon park city centre
today we're comfortable with our us circuit pricing however that's not to say we aren't monitoring currently available subscription programs
please note that our comments are necessarily summary in nature and anything we say is qualified by the more detailed disclosure set forth in our form ten-q
also as we are in both the cinema and real estate businesses we must naturally balance our capital commitments between these two sectors
let's turn to our leasing activities forty four union square is in the midtown south office leasing market
do programs like amc's stubs a-list change the way that you look into future as it relates to raising price
that mature in november and december two thousand and nineteen we are working towards having replacement credit facilities in place
according to our leasing agents the midtown south office market had a strong quarter with two point seven million square feet being leased
under development or construction that is not generating any ebitda which continues to be strong at slightly over two times coverage
we intend to be the leading asset servicer asset manager and data inside provider to the owners and managers of the world's capital this vision will be driven by five strategic priorities
before i begin my review of our fourth quarter and twenty eighteen results i'd like to take a moment on slide five to discuss notable items and how they impacted our financials
and we also had one previously disclosed client transition which was worth about two percentage points year-on-year which was offset by net new business and client activity
finally we saw a significant step-up in processing fees with the addition of crd for the first time in our fourth quarter financials
we also intend to streamline three operational hubs and two joint ventures as well as continue to drive towards common technology platforms and the retirement of legacy applications
we continue to distinguish ourselves in fx trading as well as how we've effectively driven nii growth as we've engaged with clients
manner so the expenses for crd will ramp during the year
understand what market levels you're kind of assuming i see that in the footnote you talked about five percent growth from december levels
on page six we show our gaap results in the top two panels as well as our results ex the notable items i just described for those of you who want to see some of our underlying trends
how it manifests itself in other words i think you used the phrase this year i mean this year is like two weeks old so are we talking about each new contract that comes up as it comes up and
where we saw the results and how those play through into ccar so we had a good understanding of the kind of the
and have launched a new cost savings program that will continue through twenty nineteen to reduce structural expenses while also enabling us to invest in the business appropriately
such as markets such as client flows and things like that so therefore that's why we need to redouble the efforts around there so in those periods like a twenty eighteen that we don't see that thing kind of fall off
year-over-year our revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strong performance in net interest income and fx trading as well as the contribution from the recently acquired charles river development business
all of which have been partially offset by typical pricing headwinds of just under two percentage points annually
i'll start by summarizing our expenses on an underlying basis excluding notable items in charles river and then discuss our efforts during three q and four q to keep our second half expenses flat to the first half on that basis
i would note that this operating environment is materially worse today than it was just forty five days ago when i presented at the goldman conference
certainly well in excess of many of your gcib peers i was hoping you could speak to your capacity or appetite to maybe redeem some of those preferreds and how we could possibly think about the timing of redemptions and the associated savings
in july the partnership also began construction of an additional gas processing plant to support growth in the stack shale play of oklahoma
but as we look forward toward the end of the year or perhaps early in 'eighteen there is additional heavy production coming online the fort hills project
again the primary responsibility of loop is to be an import facility and that's extremely important for us in our refineries
the volumes in july down two percent wondering how that would compare to the overall market just trying to get an assessment of
so while we see this opportunity what we want to do is we want to work with loop to make sure that there is no conflict between
and we expect that to continue we have pretty good optics of where the crude market is going over the next sixty to ninety days
we remain confident in mplx's compelling value proposition to our investors
we believe the global and us macro picture remains solid and expect that good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for our products
moving on now to twenty seventeen guidance we are reconfirming our outlook in all principal components provided on our february eight earnings call which also included the two acquisitions completed in january
an expectation -- or a prior year of fifteen point two percent so again we're more or less in line with where we thought we would be
average prices in this segment were consistent with the prior year net sales growth as reported was offset by a three percent currency translation impact
reflecting initial pressure from raw material inflation in q two which would then be mitigated in the remaining quarters with pricing actions that we have initiated and will continue to implement in cooperation with our customers
the efficiency of the paid marketing spend and our control of operating expenses enables us to remain confident about our ebitda expectations as the operating leverage shown by respective growth in revenue and expenses continues
as i mentioned the strong underlying growth in unpaid gtv has enabled us to keep the average cost under control despite the natural transition to more paid links via mobile devices
i do need to remind investors that whilst we do not expect there to be significant variances all financial figures in the four c and our presentation remain subject to half year audit review
over the course of several months the board had more than a dozen independent committee meetings plus seven full board meetings and conducted a thorough evaluation of proposals
we believe this plan will allow us to achieve the rule of forty by twenty twenty we have entered into an agreement with silver lake
in q three we continued to grow our user base adding more than one million net users amounting to a total user base of more than thirty three million subscribers
to be more services heavy in q four as we have historically experienced that many of our large enterprise clients finalize projects before year-end
will grow at about the same rate or perhaps slightly faster on a year-over-year basis than it did in q three therefore and consistent with last quarter
today we are committing to a plan which we expect allows us to achieve the rule of forty by twenty twenty with a combination of revenue growth and margin expansion
the third quarter saw the largest volume of cornerstone hr wins in the company's history
which has driven and we expect will continue to drive faster and more efficient implementations also please know a large majority of q four services revenue is expected to come from -- from our backlog of services
we believe a six percent target is the best estimate as of today but i did want to point out this nuance in our financial outlook
if you just think generally about any job you can think of today five or ten years from now that job is going to be dramatically different because of technology and the skills you need to do that new job
as a result we expect the annual improvement in sales and marketing as a percent of revenue to be even greater next year than it's been over the last two years
representing reported and constant currency growth of thirteen percent we continued to see improvements in profitability
more than doubling the number of year-to-date cornerstone hr wins among new european clients when compared to the first nine months of twenty sixteen we believe cornerstone hr will continue to drive growth
before i begin with the quarterly financial review i'd like to highlight the expected near-term financial impacts of our go-forward plan that adam just discussed the plan has two impacts the first is on revenue
and the balance was the result of solid performance in emea and favorable currency
requested by existing clients as compared to services related to new q four client wins
so the primary focus we have now is on recurring revenue growth and so the best way to drive better cac ratios
improvement initiatives that are part of our operational excellence program including those related to order to cash automation and the level zero support
as i've mentioned on previous calls we believe japan represents a substantial market opportunity and that it would become a top five market for cornerstone over time
once we better understand the impacts of our go-forward services strategy we'll have clearer insight into two thousand eighteen revenue trends and will communicate that detail with you as soon as possible in the coming months
through the first nine months of the year services revenue has been lower than historical averages due to the timing of service delivery which is often dictated by clients
the program is expected to be executed over the next two years but is not specific as to when or how many shares will be purchased
once we better understand the impacts of our go-forward services strategy we'll have a clear insight into twenty eighteen revenue trends and will communicate that detail with you as soon as possible in the coming months
in the corporate world to start to monetize that in better way and we're doing that really for two different reasons
it helps shift to more recurring revenue and helps improve the cac ratios at the same time we're looking at a number of different approaches to cost containment
clawing back and are getting closer to the thirty percent going into the third quarter
we will repeat there is not a transformational acquisition around the corner in 'seventeen it is more the bolt-on smaller type thing we have in the pipeline
we are going to build on our momentum to diversify our specialty pharmacy portfolio initially targeting oncology rheumatoid arthritis and hiv and tim will speak to the details in a few minutes
the offset -- this was offset by favorable trends in other therapies which resulted in an overall negative script performance for the quarter adjusted for ninety-day scripts of negative sixty three basis points
now i want to talk about how we are going to achieve our growth objectives over the next three to five years
in twenty seventeen we expect to incur additional expense related to consulting employee insurance and software licenses and advertising
as i approach my first one hundred days as the ceo of fred's pharmacy it is important that i share with you the vision for the company that i have shared with the board
posting a revenue improvement over the second quarter of eleven point two percent as you have heard the future of fred's pharmacy is centered squarely on healthcare and is driven by our retail and specialty pharmacies
thank you mary lou let me provide a summary of our go-forward growth strategy the three key components of our strategy revolve around optimizing our entire portfolio
our capital management included payment of a special dividend and resumption of quarterly dividends in the first quarter of two thousand sixteen this resulted in a decrease in retained earnings which caused our book value per share to decrease
the overall picture for revenue is one of growth from underlying operations complemented by our recent acquisitions and partially offset by fx translation
our dividend is a key measure of our returns to shareholders today we've announced an interim dividend of four p consistent with our progressive dividend policy
margins have improved across the group as a whole by fifty basis points the largest single improvement of which has been in plastics where the benefit of the restructuring that we've been undertaking for the last eighteen months is showing benefit
there's nobody that comes near our coverage having so many parts of europe there is nobody else we said six months ago the opportunities were there
this increase was primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates the eighty basis point rate decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage
our q four guidance reflects a number of factors first as we discussed on last quarter's call we made strategic decisions to proactively make additional investments in the back half of the year to continue to drive the best buy twenty twenty strategy forward
obviously when you're thinking about how much of your expandable income you're going to spend on ce we are quite thoughtful about that share of wallet question particularly over the holidays when people often go in with a budget and
today's release and conference call both contain non-gaap financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events
and our communities including organizing the delivery of much-needed supplies to our associates in puerto rico where we have three stores and a distribution center within a few days of the devastation
we are raising our q four outlook versus what was implied in the annual expectations provided on our last earnings call
not only in the fourth quarter but as we look out to next year we're getting a lot of noise from people that it's becoming a pretty big problem wanted to get your take on that so those two things
on top of that you asked a little bit about labor expenses one of the investments we have actually called out over almost the last two years is continued investments in specialty labor
i think you're right in that definitely especially if you look at the trends over the last five ten years you can see the holiday pulling earlier and earlier
the q four has not played like the earlier quarters of the year and so we're trying to take some of that knowledge we've gained into account as we think about where we believe the fourth quarter's going to go in terms of the revenue profile
but should not be considered superior to as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the gaap financial measures for the period
to complement all of this we've added an incremental fifteen hundred dedicated smart home store employees to make sure that when you come to shop with us we'll do a great job identifying what smart home solution would work best for you
these increases were partially offset by the flow-through of cost reductions the forty basis point rate decrease was driven by sales leverage
of lower profit share revenue than we received last q four third our fourth quarter and full year performance is expected to drive higher incentive compensation expenses in the fourth quarter than last year's fourth quarter
and then of course the volume depends on our capability depends on customers but it is a very very important program for st and we are very encouraged
in the sensors there are three blocks of technologies where we have i believe a unique technology leadership
how are they trending across your various product groups right now and if you have seen any further extensions with the course of q three or are they coming back secondly with respect to
this is an important element of amg's diversification strategy in sensors and our ability to build highly accurate sensors
and we know also that on smart power technologies with time it is important to go to twelve-inch
revision of the sales assumptions in the second half of 'seventeen any reason for that changing i know recently you talked about few tens of millions in the back half and
this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause st's results to differ materially from management's expectations and plans
more than three times faster than the average semiconductor content in cars
therefore we anticipate fourth quarter revenues to increase about ten percent at the midpoint on a sequential basis
so far away or if i consider like your largest competitor infineon in the power space going to three hundred- millimeter getting scale and scope
good progress against the canadian bank's multiyear target of one million new primary customers tangerine also performed strongly during the year
financial transactions completed by mobile devices have grown seventy five percent over the past two years and is now the most popular financial transaction channel for our customers
you should expect us i would say to be a top three participant in this industry overall
we've operated there for over nine years we're very comfortable operating in the dr and we look forward to growing our business there
we continue to see improvement across our three primary digital metrics since we launched our strategy over two years ago
